    !!! danger "List at least one experimental technique that can provide each observable listed below. Comment on their accuracy. "
    
    Translational Frictional Coefficient, $f_t$ (comp.): Since f is proportional to the diffusion
    coefficient, D, one needs to first find the diffusion coefficient. ZENO can compute this
    observable.

    Rotational Frictional Coefficient, $f_r (x, y, z)$ (comp.): Sedimentation velocity experi-
    ments.

    Frictional ratio, $f /f_0$ (comp.): Sedimentation velocity experiments.

    Hydrodynamic/ Stokes Radius, $R_H$ (obs.): Sedimentation velocity experiments.

    Radius of Gyration, $R_G$ (obs.): Computational models can be useful in determining
    the radius of gyration. One can develop a potential, likely Lennard-Jones and Coulomb
    potentials for linear polymers. A Monte-Carlo algorithm can then extract the radius.
    This is a simulation so there will be limitations due to computing powers. One would
    have consider, for example, constant and variable charge distributions. Data obtained
    from the model could be compared to experimental data to ensure optimal accuracy.

    Translational Diffusion, $D_t$ (obs.): Diffusion is only dependent on one variable, f , so
    it tends to be more reliable. A calculation of the diffusion can be done using cen-
    trifugation, particularly with sedimentation velocity experiments. Diffusion can be
    underestimated due to attempts to account for hydration, in the case of some compu-
    tation models. Dynamic light scattering can measure translational diffusion through Brownian motion.

    Rotational Diffusion, $D_r (x, y, z)$ (obs.): Since rotational diffusion deals with molecular
    orientations, any experimental process that measure it must be highly sensitive to rota-
    tional movement on a short time scale. NMR relaxation experiments and fluorescence
    correlation spectroscopy may be sensitive enough for this, although with fluorescence
    there is a condition that the rotational diffusion occurs faster than the fluorescence
    decay time.

    Intrinsic Viscosity, $\eta$ (obs.): Viscosity can be measured by calculating the viscosity
    number of the particular solution at various concentrations. A Ubbelohde viscometer
    does this. There can be surface tension effects but it is not extensive.

    Sedimentation Coefficient, $s$ (obs.): We must be aware that there will be propagation of
    error effecting s, since s is related to the translational friction, partial specific volume,
    and the mass. Sedimentation can be underestimated since one needs to account for
    hydration, which can lead to an excessive expansion of the surface. Poor knowledge or
    estimation of the partial specific volume can effect the accuracy of the sedimentation
    coefficient.

    Relaxation Time, $\tau$ (obs.): NMR relaxation experiments can be used to measure this
    variable.

    Partial Specific Volume, $\bar\nu$(obs.): The computation of ν for some macro-molecules can
    be unreliable, since the number and type of the constituent residues may not be known.

    Mass, M (obs.): Osmometry (number-average molar mass), light scattering (mass-
    averaged molar mass).

    Solvent Viscosity, $\eta_0$ (obs.): Density of viscosity affect the sedimentation and diffusion
    coefficients, so corrections must be made to standard conditions.

    Solvent Density, $\rho$ (obs.): To measure density, one only needs to know the solvent’s
    mass and volume, since ρ = M/V .

    Sedimentation velocity experiments can be used to measure: sedimentation coefficients, trans-
    lational diffusion coefficients, molecular mass (given partial specific volume), frictional coeffi-
    cient, frictional ratio (given partial specific volume or molecular weight), and Stoke’s radius.
    Also note that ZENO can compute, among other properties, the intrinsic viscosity, hydro-
    dynamic/ Stokes radius, translational diffusion coefficient, translational friction coefficient,
    radius of gyration, and the structure factor for arbitrary shaped complexes.

        PART A: Follow these steps.
    
        Step 1: We will start with calculating the frictional ratio, f, using:
    
        $$
        f = \frac{RT}{ND} = \frac{k_B T}{D}
        $$
    
        where $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $N$ is Avogadro's constant, $D$ is the diffusion           coefficent, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.
    
        Step 2: We can find the sedimentation coefficient with:
    
        $$
        s = \frac{M(1 - \bar\nu\rho)}{nF}
        $$
    
        where $M$ is the molecular weight, $\bar\nu$ is the partial specific volume, and $\rho$ is the density of the buffer.
    
        Step 3: We can use the volume equation to find the minimal radius:
    
        $$
        V = \frac{M \bar\nu}{N}
        $$

        $$
        r_0 = \left(\frac{3V}{4\pi}\right)^{1/3}
        $$
    
        Step 4: The hypothetical frictional ratio is related to the minimial radius by:
    
        $$
        f_0 = 6 \pi \eta r_0
        $$
    
        which allows us to find the frictional ratio, $f/f_0$, where $f_0$ is the frictional coefficient of a hypothetical              molecule of similar size and density, using the frictional ratio value that was calculated in Step 1.
    
        Step 5: The Stokes radius equation is:
    
        $$
        R_H = \frac{k_B T}{6\pi\eta D}
        $$
    
         where $\eta$ is the viscosity of the buffer.
    
        Our constants in these equations are:
    
        - $\rho$ = 0.9982 g/mol;
      
        - $\eta$ = 0.01 g/cm s (water at 20-degrees C);
      
        - $T$ = 293.15 k, and;
      
        - $R$ = 8.3145$\times10^7$ erg.
      
        All requested values have now been calculated.
    
        PART B: The frictional ratio, $f/f_0$, is a measure of the globularity of the molecule.
        We are able to say that the molecule that is the most non-globular will have a frictional ratio much greater than 2.5.
    
        Myosin is the most non-globular; $f/f_0$ = 4.06
    
        Ribonuclease is the most sphereical; $R_H$ = 2.01 nm and $r_0$ = 1.57 nm.
    
        PART C: We have the following equations:
    
        $$
        \left(\frac{f}{f_0} \right )^3 = \left(\frac{R_H}{r_0} \right )^3 = \frac{\bar\nu_2 - \delta\bar\nu_1}{\bar\nu_2}
        $$
    
        $$
        \delta = \frac{1}{\bar\nu_1}\left(\left(\frac{f}{f_0} \right )^3 \bar\nu_2 - \bar\nu_2 \right )
        $$
    
        and we can take $\bar\nu_1$ = 1.0 cm/g for water. These equations will allow us to determine the amount of water for             each molecule that would have to be bounded to account for the calculated Stokes' radius.

    !!! danger "Indicate if s and D increase, decrease or stay the same when the following events occur, and justify your answer. <br><br>A: an anisotropic (asymmetric) monomeric protein aggregates into a large globular blob;<br>    B: a monomeric protein unit elongates through head-to-tail association, forming a fibril shape;<br>C: a DNA molecule is dialyzed from a 500 mM NaCl solution into a 5 mM NaCl solution;<br> D: a globular, well-folded protein unfolds into a denatured state;<br>E: a monomeric, globular protein associates to form a globular hexamer."

        First, let us establish that the sedimentation coefficient, $s$, can be expressed as being proportional to $M/f$, and can also be proportional to $MD$ since the diffusion coefficient, $D$, is inversely proportional to the frictional coefficient, $f$. That is,
    
        $$
        s \propto \frac{M^{2/3}}{f/f_0}~~\text{and}~~ D \propto \frac{1}{r_0(f/f_0)}
        $$
    
        PART A: An anisotropic monomeric protein implies a large $f/f_0$. However, as the protein aggregates into a globular blob, it will cause the frictional ratio to approach 1. That means that $s \propto M^{2/3}$ and $D \propto \frac{1}{r_0}$. 
    
        PART B: In this case, a monomeric protein unit ($f/f_0 \approx$ 1) evolves into a fibril shape ($f/f_0 > 2.5$). For our expressions, an increase of the frictional ratio will result in a decrease in both the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients.

        PART A: Lorem Ipsum
    
        PART B: Lorem Ipsum
    
        PART C: Let us calculate the molecular weight that is suggested from the slope in the plot. We are given:
    
        $$
        C = C_0 ~\text{exp}\left[\frac{M(1-\bar\nu\rho)}{2RT}\omega^2(r^2-r_0^2) \right ]
         $$
    
        which can be also expressed in the form:
    
        $$
         \text{ln}~C =\text{ln}~C_0 +\frac{M(1-\bar\nu\rho)}{2RT}\omega^2(r^2-r_0^2) 
        $$
    
         such that a ln $C$ vs. $r^2 - r_0^2$ plot will produce a straight line with the y-intercept at ln $C$. We are give the slope of such a plot to be 2.092. If we are then to determine the molecular weight, we have:
    
        $$
        \frac{M(1-\bar\nu\rho)}{2RT}\omega_2 = 2.092 
        $$
    
        $$
        M = 2.092 \frac{2RT}{\omega^2(1-\bar\nu\rho)}
        $$
    
        where $T$ = 293.15 k, $\bar\nu$ = 0.65 g/cm, and $\rho$ = 1.0 g/cm. We also know that $\omega = (\pi/30)$RPM, and if the rotor is set to spin at 3,000 rpm, the angular velocity will be: $\omega = \pi \times 10^2$.
    
        $$
        MV_{\text{total}} = MV_{\text{histone octomer}} + MW_{\text{2,500 bpDNA}} + MW_{\text{chromatin}}
        $$
    
    
        PART D: Lorem Ipsum
    
        PART E: Using the fundamental equations from previous questions, we can condense them into an expression for the frictional ratio as a functino of the sedimentation coefficient:
    
        $$
        \frac{f}{f_0}(s) = \frac{M(1-\bar\nu\rho)}{Ns}\frac{1}{6\pi\nu}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\frac{N}{M\bar\nu} \right )^1/3   
        $$
    
        This will allow us to find the frictional ratio for each of the listed species.
