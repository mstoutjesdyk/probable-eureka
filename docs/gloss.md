Lino viscere: Python adhuc claudunt minata, quo ille pervenit solidumve opus. Sanguinis luna quid Styge coegit recursus et dolores cupit iacent candor enim morata iunget demissus ad! Moram vultus demissam magico caeruleam praesens removit, inplerat det contemnere, subductaque decem inritans iamque. Maturuit dis iuvatis petit aggeribus multamque dabat virga mentisque imagine?

Dicta genitor, novem non fecit erit est vocem nullum. Divesque colorum, murmurat vapore fecerat pietate nocens, adgreditur huic corniger.

`Absorbance`
:   Absorption is the result of matter taking up the energy of EM radiation and transforms it into internal energy.

`Absorbance Spectroscopy`
:   A spectroscopic technique that measures the absorption of radiaion due to its interaction with a sample.
    The sample absorbs energy, as a function of frequency or wavelength. 

`Activation Energy`
:   The minimum energy that must be produced before a chemical reaction can occur.

`Aggregation`
:   A biological phenomenon in which proteins accumulate and clump together, either intra- or extra-cellularly. 

`Anisotropy`
:   The property of a molecule

`Bouyant Density`
:   lorem ipsum

`Bouyant Density Centrifugation`
:   A form of centrifugation which uses the concept of bouyancy to seperate molecules in solution based on their density differences.

    Commonly, caesium chloride (CsCl) solution is used to produce a gradient, as CsCl molecules will become densely packed towards the bottom of a centrifuge cell, forming even layers of different densities. Molecules will travel to where their density is equal to the CsCl density, forming a sharp band.

`Centrifugal Force`
:   An inertial force that appears to act on objects, when viewed in a rotating frame of Reference.

`Isopycnic Surface`
:   A surface on constant density inside a fluid.

`Isopycnic Centrifugation`
