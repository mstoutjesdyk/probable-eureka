# Manage UltraScan DB/Local Data Sets

This module is used to displa the four main types of data that may exist for the user in the database and/or on a local disk. They are:

1. raw experimental data;

2. edited experimental data;

3. models, and;

4. noise.

This model also provides a simple means of performing processing on data: 

1. upload to DB;

2. download to local disk, and;

3. remove from DB or local.

The primary end of any processing of the data is to achieve a synchronzing of data in the database and on the local disk. It can be desirable to insure that any new data produced has a presense on a local disk for off-network work and in the database for normal day-to-day processing.
