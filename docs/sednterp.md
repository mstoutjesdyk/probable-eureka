# Sednterp

The SEDNTERP program is a general purpose tool for the interpretation of sedimentation equilibrium, sedimentation velocity, and diffusion experiments. It collects many diverse functions into a single program. SEDNTERP is useful both for computing molecular structural estimates from experimental data and for calculation of physical parameters of common buffers used in sedimentation experiments. 

It is also useful to create a database of:

* The properties of samples (proteins) you work with (molar mass, partial specific volume, hydration, UV extinction coefficients, dn/dc)

* The properties of buffers that you use in your lab (density, viscosity, refractive index, pH, composition)

* Experimental results (sedimentation coefficients, diffusion coefficients, sedimentation equilibrium results)

* The derived hydrodynamic properties of your samples (maximum possible sedimentation and diffusion coefficients, f/f0 ratio, Perrin P, Stokes radius, computed shape and dimensions from ellipsoidal or cylindrical models)

Importantly, storing this information in the program database allows you to document and reproduce any calculated values you will be using in reports or publications.
