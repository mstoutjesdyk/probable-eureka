Using this window, you can manage rotor information. Make sure that you are in the correct database. 

$\textbf{Select a Laboratory}$ Select the appropriate lab in the drop-down box. 

$\textbf{Click to Select a Rotor}$ Select the rotor that is being used.

$\textbf{Select Rotor Calibration}$ Select the correct rotor calibration profile. Rotor calibrations are sorted in reverse order by data. The most recent and best choice is at the top.

$\textbf{View Calibration Report}$ Click here to view the calibration report associated with the selected rotor.

You can come to this window from [Utilites:Rotor Calibration](/utilities-rotor), allowing you to associate the calibration you collected with an rotor. Click on the rotor you would like to associate, and click on $\textbf{Save Calibration Data}$. This action is only possible for administrators.

If you are an administrator and would like to add a new rotor, click on $\textbf{Add New Rotor}$. In the dialog, select the rotor type (AN60, AN50, or Simulation) and add the appropriate details into $\textbf{Rotor Name}$ and $\textbf{Rotor Serial Number}$. All other details are generated automatically.
