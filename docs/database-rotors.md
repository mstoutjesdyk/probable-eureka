You can come to this window from [<span style="color:#00008B";><u>Utilites:Rotor Calibration</u></span>](/probable-eureka/utilities-rotor), allowing you to associate the calibration you collected with an rotor. Click on the rotor you would like to associate, and click on <span style="color:#00008B";>Save Calibration Data</span>. This action is only possible for administrators.

If you are an administrator and would like to add a new rotor, click on <span style="color:#00008B";>Add New Rotor</span>. In the dialog, select the rotor type (AN60, AN50, or Simulation) and add the appropriate details into <span style="color:#00008B";>Rotor Name</span> and <span style="color:#00008B";>Rotor Serial Number</span>. All other details are generated automatically.
