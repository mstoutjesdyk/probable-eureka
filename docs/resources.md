!!! note "AUC Experimental Design Checklist"
     
     1. Ensure the instrument is in good-working condition, with all calibrations properly recorded.

     2. Be aware of buffer absorbance, concentration selection

          a. What are the analyte properties? sedimentation coefficenint, diffusion, partial specific volume. 

          b. What are the buffer properties? Viscosity, density

        Together, this will provide information on rotor speed, and length of experiment.

     3. Column height, temperature considerations, speed selection, and experiment length.

## Concentration Measurements

When designing AUC experiments for UV optics it is highly recommended to measure in intensity 
rather than absorbance mode. In intensity experiments one needs to make very accurate concentration 
measurements to avoid accidental gain set changes in the Beckman XL-A instruments. The reference 
channel should be filled with a 0.3 OD solution, and a 0.9 OD solution in the sample channel (both 
channels as determined in a 1.0 cm pathlength cuvette). In the XLA, typically a 1.2 cm pathlength 
centerpiece is used, which then increases absorbance to 0.36 and 1.08 OD respectively. Those levels 
are within the limits of linear detection on a well functioning XLA spectrophotometer at most 
wavelengths accessible with this instrument.

However, if the OD level in the reference channel is exceeded, gain set adjustments are likely to 
occur over the course of the experiment, leading to problematic data. This requires stopping the 
run, diluting the sample to an appropriate level, and restarting the run.

## Designing Fluorescence Binding Titration Experiments

When you perform a binding experiment in fluorescence mode, the object is to follow the labeled 
component and measure the concentration of the free and complexed fluorescently labeled component. 
Of course, in a fluorescence experiment you cannot see the unlabeled component, and this makes 
interpretation a lot easier. The unlabeled component only becomes visible indirectly, when the 
labeled component is complexed with it. So we will design the experiment to see varying amounts of 
labeled free and complexed material.
