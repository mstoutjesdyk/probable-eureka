We at the Center for Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics (CBSD) apply the methods and concepts of biophysics, structural biology and mathematics to understand the mechanistic basis of biological processes in health and disease. 

The purpose of the BioSpectroscopy Core Research Laboratory (BCRL) is to offer a centralized, shared resource for time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, single-molecule spectroscopy and fluorescence imaging that provides access to instruments, technologies, and services, as well as expert consultation.

Visit the CBSD website [here](https://hs.umt.edu/cbsd/).
