Using this window, you can manage project information on your local disk or in the current database. You must be identified as the investigator to delete or update a project description.

$\textbf{General}$

$\textbf{Goals}$ Provide a detailed description of your research. Include an abstract and explain the goals of your research. This information will be used to optimally design your experiment.

$\textbf{Molecules}$ For each analyte to be measured provide: name, appropriate molar mass, and partial specific volume (it if was measured); and, for proteins, provide: sequence in single-letter code. For each submitted sample, please enter a detailed sample description key for the label used on each tube.

$\textbf{Purity}$ Indicate the approximate purifty of your sample(s) in percentages.

$\textbf{Expense}$ How much material (volume, concentration) is avaliable for your research? Identify concentration of your samples in absorbance units, wavelength, or type of fluorescence label and its molar concentration. For samples to be measured in the UV/vis absorbance optics, provide an absorbance scan against buffer from 215-700 nm for each sample.

$\textbf{Buffer Components}$ List the molar concentrations of each component in your buffer, including reductants and nucleotides. Provide a buffer scan against ddH20 from 215-700 nm. To minimize absorbance, we prefer to use phosphate or optically pure TRIS. To avoid hydrodynamic non-ideality, a minimum salt concentration of 20 mM is desired. Please explain if this is not possible. If reductants are required, please use TCEP which can be measured at wavelengths > 260 nm.

$\textbf{Sample Handling}$ Indicate the ideal storage conditions: temperature (room, 4, -20 or -80 Celcius), sample shelf life, any health/safety concerns, and proper care for working with and disposing of your sample. State if you would like the remaining used or unused sample returned to use.

$\textbf{AUC Questions}$ What questions are you trying to answer with AUC? How do you propose to approach the research with AUC experiments?

$\textbf{Experimental Design}$

$\textbf{Notes}$ Indicate any special instuctions, questions, and extra notes.
