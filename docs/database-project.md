<span style="color:#00008B";>General</span>

<span style="color:#00008B";>Goals</span> Provide a detailed description of your research. Include an abstract and explain the goals of your research. This information will be used to optimally design your experiment.

<span style="color:#00008B";>Molecules</span> For each analyte to be measured provide: name, appropriate molar mass, and partial specific volume (it if was measured); and, for proteins, provide: sequence in single-letter code. For each submitted sample, please enter a detailed sample description key for the label used on each tube.

<span style="color:#00008B";>Purity</span> Indicate the approximate purify of your sample(s) in percentages.

<span style="color:#00008B";>Expense</span> How much material (volume, concentration) is available for your research? Identify concentration of your samples in absorbance units, wavelength, or type of fluorescence label and its molar concentration. For samples to be measured in the UV/vis absorbance optics, provide an absorbance scan against buffer from 215-700 nm for each sample.

<span style="color:#00008B";>Buffer Components</span> List the molar concentrations of each component in your buffer, including reductants and nucleotides. Provide a buffer scan against ddH20 from 215-700 nm. To minimize absorbance, we prefer to use phosphate or optically pure TRIS. To avoid hydrodynamic non-ideality, a minimum salt concentration of 20 mM is desired. Please explain if this is not possible. If reductants are required, please use TCEP which can be measured at wavelengths > 260 nm.

<span style="color:#00008B";>Sample Handling</span> Indicate the ideal storage conditions: temperature (room, 4, -20 or -80 Celsius), sample shelf life, any health/safety concerns, and proper care for working with and disposing of your sample. State if you would like the remaining used or unused sample returned to use.

<span style="color:#00008B";>AUC Questions</span> What questions are you trying to answer with AUC? How do you propose to approach the research with AUC experiments?

<span style="color:#00008B";>Experimental Design</span>

<span style="color:#00008B";>Notes</span> Indicate any special instuctions, questions, and extra notes.
