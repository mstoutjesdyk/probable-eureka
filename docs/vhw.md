# Van Holde-Weischet Method

The vHW method[^vanHolde1978] can be used for the initial qualitative analysis for SV. We know that sedimentation is a transport process propotional to the first power of time, while diffusion is a transport process which is proportional to the square-root power of time. At infinity, transport due to diffusion will be neglible compared to transport due to sedimentation, and it will provide an integral sedimentation coefficient distribution, $G(s)$.

The van Holde-Weischet Analysis is applicable for the following examples:

* Concentration dependend non-ideality of the sedimenatin coefficient

* Aggregation and Irreversible self-Association

* Composition Analysis

* Reversibly self-associating systems vs. non-interacting systems

* Stoichiometry of association

* Relative quantification of individual components

* Conformational information
