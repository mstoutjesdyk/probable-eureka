# Color Gradient Generator

This module is used to generate color gradients for the purpose of providing a third dimension to selected UltraScan program graphs.

Color gradients are specified with a start color and a number of color steps. Each gradient has an end color and a number of points. The total number of colors in the gradient is the sum of the end points plus one (for start color). The steps are saved in an XML file, with an option to save a PNG file with a color legend.
