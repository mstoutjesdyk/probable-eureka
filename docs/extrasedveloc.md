![](/img/sedequil.png){width="300"align=right}

Sedimentation equilibrium experiments run samples at slower rotor speeds, so that the sample can simultaneously sediment and back diffuse from the bottom of the cell, producing a gradient. This gradient will not change once equilibrium is reached. At equilibirium, the net flow of material in the cell will cease, and sedimentation and diffusion will balance each other. The curvature of the gradient is influenced by the rotor speed, and multiple gradients at different speeds can be used to globally fit data to a model.  

SE experiments provide: 

* molecular weight with superior accuracy for monodisperse systems 

* provide thermodynamic information (binding strength) 

* confirmation on the presence of single oligomeric states for proteins. 


$$
\ln{\frac{c(r_{2}}{c(r_{1}}} = \left(\frac{M(1-\bar\nu\rho)\omega^{2}}{2RT} \right)(r_2^2 - r_1^2)
$$

$$
\frac{M(1-\bar\nu\rho)\omega^{2}}{2RT}
$$

## Density Gradient

$$
v = \frac{r\omega^{2}M(1-\bar\nu\rho)}{N_A(6\pi\eta rF)} = constant
$$

$$
\frac{r(1-\bar\nu\rho)}{\eta} = constant
$$


## Equilibirum Density-Gradient

$$
v = \frac{r\omega^2 (m - V\rho)}{f}
$$

        * Sedimentaion Velocity: a moving boundary is generated because the rotor speed is large enough to prevent back diffusion from the cell bottom to influence the absorbance near the meniscus, which will deplete over time.

         * Sedimentation Equilibirum: the rotor speed is slow enough such that the back diffusion at the bottom of the cell will balance out the sedimentation and form an equilibrium gradient.

         * Equilibirum Density-Gradient: consists of centrifuging macromolecules to equilibirum as bands on a suitably                    constructed gradient.
