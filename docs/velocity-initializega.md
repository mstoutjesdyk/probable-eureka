# Initialize Genetic Algorithm

Solute distribution data can be used to generate data for use with Genetic Algorithm analysis programs. The output data results from choosing bins (or buckets) around solute points. These buckets can be modified for better results. Once they are as desired, data for Genetic Algorithm analysis can be generated and output. 

The input data may come in one of two flavors, each of which is treated differently. The data is either SA2D type or Monte Carlo. The 2DSA is relatively sparse and generally requires fashioning buckets containing a single point.
