## Beckman AUC  Rotor Types
The only rotors that can be used with the Optima AUC and the ProteomeLab XL-A/I are the An-60 Ti, and An-5- Ti rotors.

The An-60 Ti and An-50 Ti  rotors are manufactured in an NSAI-registerd ISO 9001 or 9002 facility for the use 
with the appropriately classified Beckman-Coulter analyitical ultracentrifuges.

RCF = relative centrifugal field. RCF is the ratio of the centrifugal acceleration of a specified radius and speed to the standard acceleration of gravity. It is represented by

equation

where r is the radius (mm), w is the angular velocity (radians per second), and g is the standard acceleration of gravity (9807 mm/s2).

In both rotors, the cell holes are numbered for easy identification, and have a handle attached for easy lifting.

Rotors should always be placed on their stands when not in the ultracentrifuge to prevent damage to the overspeed disk.

For overspeed protection, a photoelectric detector in the XL-A/XL-I analytical ultracentri-
fuge monitors the overspeed disk on the bottom of the rotor and shuts down the run if speeds
exceeding the rotorâ€™s rated maximum are detected. In addition, magnets have been inserted
in the overspeed disk between cell holes 1 and 4 (An-60 Ti) or 1 and 8 (An-50 Ti). A sensor
in the rotor chamber, triggered by these magnets, is used for timing the light sources. Special
care should be taken to avoid damaging this dual-purpose disk; always set the rotor down
carefully on the rotor stand or drive spindle.

## Rotor Safety

The forces generated in high-speed ultracentrifuges like the Optima AUC are enormous. For 
example, if 1 gram of a material was placed on the botto of a rotor bucket rotating at 60,000 
rpm, we would find it would exert the gravitational equibalent of 0.5 ton of centrifugal mass 
at the bottom of the bucket.

We must also take into account that the strucutral failure characteristic that make metal rotors 
dangerous is their propensity to catastrophically fail. That is, having a significiant mass removed from the main body while at speed.
This is what that looks like:

-The seperated piece is thrown into the sidde of the centrifuge at extremely high speeds.

-The centrifuge will immediately go into a violent state of imbalance. Hopefully, it will shut off before more damage occurs.

-The main body of the rotor may strike the side wall of the centrifuge.

-Less concerning, but the cells containing your sample will be broken, and liquid exposed.

This is illustrated [here](https://ehrs.upenn.edu/health-safety/lab-safety/safety-alerts/ultracentrifuge-explosion-damages-laboratory) by PennEHRS. 

After all, rotor safety while in the rotor chamber is linked to rotor balance. The mass of the rotor must 
be evenly distrubted on the drive hub, allowing the rotor to turn smoothly. An improperly 
loaded rotor will be unbalanced and consistent running of unbalanced rotors will cause the 
drive life to diminish. To balance a rotor, fill all opposing tubes to the same level with 
liquid of the same density, and check the mass of each cell. Opposite cells must be within 0.5 
o
g of each other.

## Life, Maintenance, and Retirement

Proper Care and Handling of a AUC Rotor includes:

* Recording of the purchase data, manufacturing data, and serial number.

* Reading of the manuals before use, and following all operational specificiations that the manufactuer recommends.

* Not exceeding the maximum speed and sample density ratings. Speed reductions are required for running high-density solutions.

* Keeping a well-kept rotor log that includes date, user, rotor used, and any problems encountered.

* Storing the rotors in a dry environment, not in the centrifuge.

* Regular cleaning/decontamination/sterilization

    * The rotor body can be autoclaved at 121-degrees Celsius for up to an hour, if necessary.

* Frequent Inspections

    * Periodly inspect the rotor, particularly inside cavities, while looking for any rough spots, cracks, pitting, or heavy discoloration. 
      If any of these are evident, do not use that rotor.

    * Inspect the overspeed disk. If scratched, damaged, or missing, do not use rotor until it is replaced.

* Corrosin prevention


#### Overspeed Disk Replacement

1. Pry up the edes of the old disk with a scalpel, taking care not to scratch the rotor, then peel the disk off.

2. Clean the area around the drive hole with acetone to remove any old adhesive.

3. Peel the paper backing off the new disk (do not touch the adhesive) and fit it around the hole (a centering tool may be used).

4. Allow the disk to set for a minimum of 2 hours.
