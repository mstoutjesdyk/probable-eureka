As biochemists and biophysicsts, we need to be able to:

1. Undersand the underlying chemistry of our subject

2. Understand the capabilies of our instrumentation

3. Ask the right questions

4. Design the right experiments to test our hypotheses

5. Build the appropriate methods

6. Collect the appropriate data

7. Properly analyze that data

8. Interpret the results
    
9. Combine information from multiple methods, if necessary to arrive at an answer
 
Knowning this, this AUC University site was created so that users can survery modern biophysical techniques that are used for the characterization of biological macromolecules in solution state.
