# Oki! Welcome!

The University of Lethbridge, Alberta, is located Treaty 7 territory which is the traditional land of the Blackfoot Confederacy (Kainai, Siksika, and Piikani), the Tsuu T'ina, and the Metis peoples of Southern Alberta. We strive to acknowledge their ownership of this land, and to return it back to them.

As biochemists and biophysicsts, we need to be able to:

1. Undersand the underlying chemistry of our subject

2. Understand the capabilies of our instrumentation

3. Ask the right questions

4. Design the right experiments to test our hypotheses

5. Build the appropriate methods

6. Collect the appropriate data

7. Properly analyze that data

8. Interpret the results
    
9. Combine information from multiple methods, if necessary to arrive at an answer
