(2010). A two-dimensional spectrum analysis for sedimentation velocity experiments of mixtures with heterogeneity in molecular weight and shape. European Biophysics Journal , 39 (3), 405-414. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00249-009-0413-5 An acceptable method for the approzimation for most systems is the model for a mixture of individual non-interacting solutes as described by the Lamm equation. 1 The Lamm Equation 2 descibes the sedimentation and diffusion transport of a single ideal solute in an AUC cell. Therefore, for a mixture of non-interacting solutes, the total concentration \\(C_{T}\\) of all solutes \\(n\\) can be represented by a sum of Lamm equation solutions \\(L\\) : \\[ C_{T} = \\sum^{n}_{i=1} c_{i}L(s_{i}, D_{i}). \\] Finding the correct values of \\(c_{i}\\) , \\(s_{i}\\) , and \\(D_{i}\\) is the challenge when fitting experimental velocity data, and require an optimziation approach that can deal with the non-linearity. One way of doing this is to use iterative fitting methods using non-linear squares optimization. 3 4 [^Schuck1998] But there are drawbacks: the correct model must be selected and verified by user leading to bias in analysis, and; the non-linear least squares tends to break down for systems containing three of more components. This is due to the complexity of the error surface , where simply gradient descent methods fail to navigate the complex, multi-dimensional error surfaces, tending to be traped by local minima, never converging to the global optima. It can also be due to the presence of multiple minima with nearly identical residuals, or the failure to consider additional signals from the inadequacy of the selected models. The C(s) method 5 6 was developed to address these drawbacks by implementing a system linearization avoiding multi-dimensional searchs by iterative methods. In an extention of c(s) method, a regularized searchover a course grid of both \\(s\\) and \\(f/f_{0}\\) was added. The idea behind this linearization method is as follows: the sedimentation ocefficient range is assumed to represened by the solutes in the experiment, divided into equidistant partitions. the diffusion coefficent is treated as a constant and is parameterized with the sedimentation coefficient, \\(s\\) , and frictional ratio, \\(k = f/f_{0}\\) : \\[ D = RT \\left[18\\pi N(k\\eta)^{3/2}\\left(\\frac{s\\bar\\nu}{2(1-\\bar\\nu\\rho)} \\right)^{1/2} \\right]^{-1}. \\] The constant \\(k = f/f_{0}\\) is held constant throughout our \\(C_{T}\\) equation, so that only coefficeint \\(c_{i}\\) need to be determined, while assuming that the coefficients are only greater than or equal to zero. Therefore, for the C(s) method, a single-dimensional non-linear search over \\(k\\) is added to identify an approximate weight average \\(k\\) for \\(\\textbf{all}\\) solutes present. This raises several concerns. First, by treating \\(k\\) to be constant, generality is sacrified. It will only be sufficient for single components, or if all species in a mixture are spherical and the frictinoal ratio is equal to 1. In heterogenous mixtures, when this average frictional ratio value is used to transfform the \\(s\\) -value distrubtion into a molecular weight distribution, there will be an overestimatization of the molecular weight of the most globular component, and an underestimization of the least globular components molecular weight. To address this issue, Brookes and Demeler, amoung others, have explored stochastic search algorithms, with evidencing showing that it is possible to resolve more than two comonents in a mixture with the same level of detail as direct boundary fitting methods. However, these methods require comparatively higher computational efforts, and are impractical for implementing to workstations. Overall, the C( \\(s, f/f_{0}\\) method suffers from: a lack of resolution; large memory needs; producing unnecessarily broad molecular weight distributions, and; 6 introducing false positives caused by noise in the data and by failing to consider the entire parameter space in each minimization step. The 2DSA method is a model-independent approach for fitting sedimentation velocity data which permits simultaneous determination of shape and molecular distributions for mono- and polydisperse solutions of macromolecules. 2DSA is based on fine grained 2-D grid searches over sedimentation coefficients and frictional ratios. The grid is a linear combination of whole boundary models represented by finite element solutions of the Lamm equation. Grid points correspond to the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients present in the Lamm equation. This approach allows for heterogeneity in the frictional domain. This allows for a more faithful description of the experimental data for cases where frictional ratios are not identical for all components. As a result of allowing frictional heterogeneity, the 2DSA method allows for a more reliable molecular weight distributions. Overall, the 2DSA method allows for: globablly fitting multi-speed experiments; the elimination of time- and radially- invarient noise; use on a single work station in a serial implementation or in a parallel computing environment for improved computational seed; superiour accuracy and lower variance fits to experimentat data; identifying modes of aggregation and slow polymerization, and; characterizing confidence limits for determined solutes using Monte Carlo approaches. The examples presented below will demonstrate that, for non-interacting systems, the 2DSA approach is general and model-independent, and does not depend on prior knowledge of the underlying model. For mixtures of rapidly equilibibrating solutes, this approach provides approximations for solutes distributions (although interaction coefficients like equilibiurm and rate constants cannot be obtained). This method also simultaneoulsy resolves heterogeneity in shape and in molecular weight or sedimentation coefficients at a very high resolution, while producing well defined and narrow solute boundaries. Description of Method The 2DSA method is built on the approach of modeling experimental seimentation data by building a two-dimensional grid of frictional ratios and sedimentation coefficients. Using the van Holde-Weischet method or the \\(d\\) C \\(/dt\\) method, one can obtain a knowledge of the fitting limits for \\(s\\) and \\(f/f_{0}\\) , which is the only user input required by the 2DSA. the \\(d\\) C \\(/dt\\) mwrhod is preferred for initialization when there is significant time-invariant noise, as it is superiour in its handling capabilities. To parameterize the diffusion coefficient, it is convinient to use the frictional ratio. Recall the diffusion equation presented above. Using that equation, a unique value for \\(s\\) and \\(D\\) can be defined at each grid point. This can also be used to simulate a velocity exeriment for a species with those specific parameters. To simulate all Lamm equation models, you can use the adaptive space-time finite element solution, 11 and built the sum: \\[ C_{T} = \\sum^{m}_{i}\\sum^{n}_{j} c_{i,j}L[s_{i}, D(s_{i}, k_{j})], \\] where \\(s_{i}\\) is the sedimentaiton coefficient at position \\(i\\) , the fricitonal ratio at \\(j\\) is \\(k_{j}\\) , \\(m\\) is the number of grid points in the sedimentation domain, and \\(n\\) is the number of grid points in the fricitonal ratio domain. The parital concentration of the simulated solutes at grid points \\((i,j)\\) is then \\(c_{i,j}\\) . The minimization problem can be states as the task of finding the minimum for the \\(l^{2}\\) -norm: \\[ \\text{MIN} = \\sum^{h}_{r} \\sum^{l}_{t} [E_{r,t} - C_{Tr,t} ]^{2}, \\] where \\(E_{r,t}\\) referes to teh experimentally determined data points for \\(h\\) radial points \\(r\\) and \\(l\\) time scans \\(t\\) . The minimization problem is solved using the NNLS algorithm, 9 while simultaneoulsy algebraically accounting for the time- and radially- invariant noise contributions in the experimental data.[^SchuckDemeler1999] The linear optimization, in matrix form, is: \\[ \\bf{A}x = \\bf{b}, \\] where \\(\\bf{A}\\) is the matrix of finite element solutions, \\(x\\) is the solution vector containng all coefficients \\(c_{i,j}\\) , and \\(\\bf{b}\\) is the vector of experimental data. MULTI-STAGE REFINEMENT: Lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum. SIMULATION OF GRID ELEMENTS: The ASTFEM solution 10 is used to simulate the Lamm equation solutions for each grid point. You can take advantage of the invariance: \\[ C(as, aD)_{r,t} = C(s,D)_{r,at}, \\] where \\(a\\) is a multiplier that cover the entire desired range of \\(s\\) and \\(D\\) values, to reduce computational effort. ITERATIVE REFINEMENT: Solving the iterative problem involving mutiple low resolution sub-gribs can be empirically shown to be equivalent to solving a high resolution grid covering the same grid points, if the following operations are performed: the non-zero grid points evaluated at the final state are joined with each original grid and processed. The analysis is repeated until convergence is obtained such that an sparse parameter distribution with discrete solutes is identified from the experimental data. Note that this method will not converge to exactly the same solution when time- or radially- invariant noise corrections are performed simulataneously, but these difference are negliable. Example 1 2DSA-Monte Carlo analysis of a 2-component system with heterogeneity in mass and shape In order to illustrate the ability of the 2DSA method to resolve a system that is heterogeneous in molecular weight and shape, the following system was used. It consisted of: a globular protein (heen egg lyzosyme), and; an elongated molecule (208 bp linear fragment of double-stranded DNA). The lyzosyme has a partial specific volume of 0.724 ccm/g and the DNA has a partial specific volume of 0.55 ccm/g. These molecules were mixed in approximately equally absorbing amounts in 200 mM NaCL and 25 mM TRIS buffer at pH 8.0. The mixture was then run at 42,000 rpm in the standard 2 channel centerpeices, with velocity data collected for 3 hours at 260 nm. Time invariant noise was subtracted so that only stochatic noise would remain in the data. 7 This data was then fitting with the 2DSA method using 50 Monte Carlo iterations, using the iterative refinement method with a maximum of 5 iterations. 8 Figure: 2DSA Monte Carlo Analysis of Velocity Data 2DSA Monte Carlo analysis of velocity data from a mixture of a 208 bp DNA fragment (black lines) and hen egg lysozyme (blue lines). Heavy lines indicate the mean, thin lines represent 95% confidence intervals for the parameter. The results for several parameters from multiple grid resolutions are compared. \\(\\textbf{a}\\) frictional ratio; \\(\\textbf{b}\\) sedimentation coefficient (corrected to standard conditions); \\(\\textbf{c}\\) molecular weight, horizontal lines indicate theoretical molecular weight based on sequence; \\(\\textbf{d}\\) partial concentration and the residual mean square deviation of the fit (red line). Reliable results are obtained after a minimum of 10,000 iterations; higher resolutions do not improve the results significantly. The following observations were made: The 2DSA is a very robust method. Additonal degenergy was introduced when the resolution of the grid was increased but it did not degrade the solutions reliability. The method faithfully reproduces known molecular weights with great precision and accuracy when adjusted for the appropraite partial specific volumes. There is additional benefit derived when using iterative refinements.

At the low resolution, the composition is porrly defined and the solute peaks are split. At higher resolutions, both species are well defined into narrow regions. Noise contributions are well seperated and idenifiable by the upper frictional ratio fitting limit ( \\(k=f/f_{0}\\) =4). The color scale represents the signal of each species in optical density units. Example 2 Multi-speed 2DSA-Monte Carlo analysis of a simulated 5-component system with heterogeneity in mass and shape The simulated system consisted of equal concentrations of a linearly elongated aggregate and five non-interacting components: monomer (25 kDa, \\(f/f_{0}\\) =1.2); dimer (50 kDa, \\(f/f_{0}\\) =1.4); tetramer (100 kDa, \\(f/f_{0}\\) =1.6); octomer (200 kDa, \\(f/f_{0}\\) =1.8); hexadecamer (400 kDa, \\(f/f_{0}\\) =2.0). Each simulation contained 70 equally spaced scans, resulting in experiment length of ~128 hours at 10 krpm, ~14 hours at 30 krpm, and ~3.5 hours at 60 krpm. Figure 2: Pseduo-3D plots for 2DSA Monte Carlo Results (Multi-Speed) Pesudo-3D plots for Monte Carlo 2DSA analysis resuls for a simulated five-component system. \\(\\textbf{a}\\) single speed fit (10 krpm), concentional centerpiece; \\(\\textbf{b}\\) single speed fit (60 krpm), conventional centerpiece; \\(\\textbf{c}\\) global multi-speed fit (10, 30, 60 krpm), conventional centerpiece; \\(\\textbf{d}\\) global multi-speed fit (10, 30, 60 krpm), conventional and band-forming Vinograd centerpeice combined. Yellow crosses indicate the position of known solutes that were simulated for the original data. The color scale represents the signal of each species in optical density units. From the multi-speed pseudo-3D plots above, the following observations were made: Single speed fits at 10 krpm with the conventional centerpeice shows poorly resolved signal bands. Single speed fits at 60 krpm with the conventional centerpiece shows more precise defintion of the horizonatal domain, but has a poorly defined frictional range. The global multi-speed fit with the conventional centerpiece eliminates the peak splitting of the medium sized species (tetramer, 100 kDa). However the hexadecamer (400 kDa) was poorly defined with peak splitting. The best fit with full peak splitting resolved is found in the global multi-speed fit when combining data from the conventional centerpiece and the band-forming Vinograd centerpiece. Here, all determined signals fit exceptionally well to the starting parameters. Schuck, P. (2003).

Yellow crosses indicate the position of known solutes that were simulated for the original data. The color scale represents the signal of each species in optical density units. From the multi-speed pseudo-3D plots above, the following observations were made: Single speed fits at 10 krpm with the conventional centerpeice shows poorly resolved signal bands. Single speed fits at 60 krpm with the conventional centerpiece shows more precise defintion of the horizonatal domain, but has a poorly defined frictional range. The global multi-speed fit with the conventional centerpiece eliminates the peak splitting of the medium sized species (tetramer, 100 kDa). However the hexadecamer (400 kDa) was poorly defined with peak splitting. The best fit with full peak splitting resolved is found in the global multi-speed fit when combining data from the conventional centerpiece and the band-forming Vinograd centerpiece. Here, all determined signals fit exceptionally well to the starting parameters. Schuck, P. (2003).

Ralston G (1993) Introduction to analytical ultracentrifugation. Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, C The absorbance optics in the Beckman Coulter AUCs use high-intensity xenon flash lamps that allow for the use of wavelengths ranging from 190 nm to 800 nm. The lamp is fired briefly as the sector passes the detector. A slit below the sample allows for sampling of different radial positions. Multiple readings at the same position can be collected and averaged, minimizing noise. The triggering of the lamp is based on the exact measurement of the actual rotor speed, which is realized by a Hall-effect sensing devices based on the over-speed disk on the bottom of the rotor. As the over-speed disk passes a sensing device, an electrical signal is induced. The position of the cell, and that of the cell sector, can then be determined. The duration of a single flash is about 2 -3 \\(\\mu\\) s, and with a maximum shot frequency of 100 Hz, the flash lamp can flash every ten revolutions at the maximum speed of 60,000 rpm. The aperture of the lens-slit assembly determines radial resolution. It moves using a step-motor (XLA) driven by a motor. The step width, \\(\\Delta\\) r can be adjusted is necessary. The lens focuses the light on the photo-multiplier tube, which measures the intensity of light passing through the measuring cell. The camera lens of the lens-slit assembly creates an image of a slice of constant radius. Another aperture at the bottom of the lens-slit assembly reduces the stray light. When to Use Samples can be examined in concentrations that are too dilute for systems such as Schlieren optics. This accessibility to lower concentrations means that one can now examine stronger interactions, \\(K > 10^{7}\\) M \\(^{-1}\\) . DRAWBACKS: duration of measurement; Wiener skewing The optical absorbance system is the most widely used detector in the AUC. In the XL-I, the absorbance system requires a at least a minute in order to scan a single sample, and it has notoriously poor wavelength reproducability. 1 Ideally, you want a continuous light source and software synchronization, simultaneous acquisition of data from samples, 100-fold better wavelength reproducibility, 10-fold higher sensivitivy and precision, and twice the radial resolution. 2 OPTICAL DENSITY: Boasts a lower limit of ~0.1 OD due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (optimal at 230 nm). Generally should not be used for samples with an optical density above 1.0 OD. At that point, there may be non-linearity of the absorbance signal. WAVELENGTHS: Use lower wavelengths for small protein concentrations. Protein extinction is usually 3-10 fold better when using 230 nm over 280 nm. Do not measure at concentrations above 0.9-1.0 O.D. Check extinction profiles of your sample. In SV-AUC, do not change the wavelength mid-run. When measuring multiple concentrations at different wavelengths, perform multiple runs. For DNA and DNA-protein complexes: scanning at 260 nm enables much lower sample concentrations, due to the high extinction profiles of DNA. BUFFERS: Buffers should not absord, or only a very little. This requirement can mean that you must exclud strong UV-absorbing species such as DTT. Always check aborbance again a water blank to confirm the level of baseline absorbance. Most of the signal should come from the sample, not the buffer. All together, both analyte and bufffer should not exceed the dynamic range of the detector. Intensity vs. Absorbance Cn be used to measure samples in the reference channel as long as the total OD is less than 0.5 OD to avoid resetting of PMT setting. In general, fill centerpiece as full as possible (~0.46 ml), but leave some room above the meniscus to provide an air region for intensity referencing. Requires time/radially invariant noise removal by fitting with 2DSA . Reduces stochastic noise by a factor of the square root of 2. Provides absolute intensity data to check instrument performance. When designing AUC experiments for UV optics it is highly recommended to measure in intensity rather than absorbance mode. Unlike absorbance data, intensity data is not convoluted with the random noise acquired in a reference measurement, producing better fits with lower RMSD values. In the process of collecting absorbance data in the Beckman XL-A, the reference channel data is subtracted from the sample channel data, thereby convoluting the random noise from the reference channel with the random noise from the sample channel. Whenever two noisy vectors are added or subtracted from each other, the noise level increases by the square root of 2, or a factor of ~ 1.4. The UltraScan software used in our laboratory is perfectly capable of accurately calculating the baseline levels of any experimental dataset using established algorithms, so a reference subtraction as done in absorbance experiments is no longer needed. There are other advantages: In intensity mode both channels are scanned into separate datasets, making it possible to double the capacity of the instrument by using both channels for samples. There is only one catch: The OD in the reference channel must be less than 0.5 OD (as detected in a 1.2 cm pathlength cell), regardless of wavelength, to prevent a resetting of the photomultiplier gain set. If the total OD (including baseline absorbance compared to ddH2O) is less than 0.5 OD, the gainsets will not be changed. A gainset adjustment in the XLA during the experiment has important consequences: The data will be rescaled at a different scale, the baselines will shift, and the entire experimental data can no longer be globally analyzed in a single fit. Each dataset acquired at a different gainset needs to be analyzed separately (although the individual datasets can still be combined to be analyzed in a global fit). But this is tedious and inconvenient. This limitation actually works in our favor: For many proteins it is interesting to study the protein at different concentrations. If a protein is reversibly self-associating, measuring a 0.3 and a 0.9 OD concentration under the same conditions will reveal mass action effects and tell us if the protein is self-associating. Hence, it is advisable to always measure at least two concentrations of each sample (0.3 and 0.9 OD, as measured in a standard 1.0 cm pathlength cuvette), with the 0.3 OD sample placed into the reference channel, and the 0.9 OD sample into the sample channel.

in the 1920's, while the knowledge of centrifugation has been around for centuries. It was in Uppsala, Sweden, where Theodor \"The\" Svedberg build the first ultracentrifuge with his co-workers in 1924. This instrument utilized a hydrogen atmosphere and sector shaped cells. Svedberg was initially interested in gold particle size distributions, but was redirected to performing sedimentation equilibrium experiments to study the tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins. Click here to read Theodor's paper on protein molecules. The first sedimentation velocity experiment verified a hemo-globin mass, which was identical to the 68,000 g/mol that was measured by the equilibrium experiment, and confirmed the presence of a single diffusion component. In the 1940's, Edward Pickel developed an ultracentrifuge that would perform under vacuum, greatly reducing heat from any frictional interactions. Edward Pickel also started SPINCO (Specialized Instruments Company), which was later acquired by Beckman (now Beckman-Coulter). The Model E also allowed for the development of the Rayleigh interferometric optical system, 1 and the photoelectric scanning absorbance optical system. 2 The short column technique for sedimentation equilibrium 3 4 and density gradient equilibrium experiments 5 were developed in parallel. AUC was left behind as newer and faster analytical methods were developed, but when Beckman introduced the XL-A instrument in 1992, its use increased. This newer AUC produced digital absorbance data, were smaller, and overall more easily maintained and serviced. Today, AUC is a powerful technique in biophysics for several reasons: AUC has unmatched resolution due to hydrodynamic separations of all molecules based on their size, density, and anisotropy.

It was in Uppsala, Sweden, where Theodor \"The\" Svedberg build the first ultracentrifuge with his co-workers in 1924. This instrument utilized a hydrogen atmosphere and sector shaped cells. Svedberg was initially interested in gold particle size distributions, but was redirected to performing sedimentation equilibrium experiments to study the tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins. Click here to read Theodor's paper on protein molecules. The first sedimentation velocity experiment verified a hemo-globin mass, which was identical to the 68,000 g/mol that was measured by the equilibrium experiment, and confirmed the presence of a single diffusion component. In the 1940's, Edward Pickel developed an ultracentrifuge that would perform under vacuum, greatly reducing heat from any frictional interactions. Edward Pickel also started SPINCO (Specialized Instruments Company), which was later acquired by Beckman (now Beckman-Coulter). The Model E also allowed for the development of the Rayleigh interferometric optical system, 1 and the photoelectric scanning absorbance optical system. 2 The short column technique for sedimentation equilibrium 3 4 and density gradient equilibrium experiments 5 were developed in parallel. AUC was left behind as newer and faster analytical methods were developed, but when Beckman introduced the XL-A instrument in 1992, its use increased. This newer AUC produced digital absorbance data, were smaller, and overall more easily maintained and serviced. Today, AUC is a powerful technique in biophysics for several reasons: AUC has unmatched resolution due to hydrodynamic separations of all molecules based on their size, density, and anisotropy. AUC does not require any standards, as it is a first principle technique, and a partial differential equation (the Lamm Equation) can exactly describe the flow of solution within an AUC cell. AUC has a large dynamic range, with variable rotor speed, allowing for variable buffer densities and viscosities, with high sensitivity from pico-molar to high micro-molar concentrations.

(2020). A calibration disk for the correction of radial errors from chromatic aberration and rotor stretch in the Optima AUC TM analytical ultracentrifuge. European Biophysics Journal , 49 (8). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00249-020-01434-z To address the issues related to AUC instrument hardware, a calibration disk has been developed as well as experimental procedures and UltraScan modules to carefully measure specific hardware effects and correct them during fitting by calibrations of the chromatic aberration and rotor stretch. Design Features The calibration disk has a geometry with two sector-shaped channels, each divided into seven open sectors for each channel, and six ribs. Each sector is 3.7-degrees wide, wider than a standard 2-channel epon-charcoal centerpiece, which is only 2.5-degrees wide, and is offset by 0.9-degrees from the centre-line. A guide note (1.6 mm x 0.5 mm) is included to ensure proper alignment in the cell housing. The following requirements were considered when designing this disk. We want to maximize the number of edges, so that we could allow for a greater number of position replicates, thus allowing for improved statistics of a rotor stretch protocol. The openings were designed to be at least 500 um wide to prevent overlaps in the inner and outer edge position recordings. The ribs were at least 100 um wide, to ensure sufficient stability when the rotor is spinning at high speeds. The Optima AUC uses a photo-multiplier tube to detect light passing through the sample. The instrument adjusts the photo-multiplier voltage based on the opaqueness of the sample. The UV detector performs this check at 65.0 mm in the center of the reference channel. It is important to ensure that the light path is never blocked at this position; if it were, the photo-multiplier voltage would be set to the maximum gain, flooding the detector with too much light in the open sections. Therefore, we created the 4th open section (center hole) to be positioned in such a way that there will be an opening for the light intensity calibration, regardless of any rotor stretch. Thus, we can assume that the photo-multiplier voltage will always be set to an appropriate amount, irrespective of wavelength or rotor stretch. At each rotor speed, a delay-time calibration procedure is performed to determine the precise angle of the rotor, and to find the sample cell channels. The instrument is programmed to use to find the counterbalance's inner calibration hole, and uses them to obtain a precise angle for the calibration hole. To replicate this feature, the innermost open sector is longer, and position in the same position as the calibration holes of the counterbalance. This permits the calibration disk to be used for delay calibration purposes as well. The shape of the edges follow the circle of their radii, and the sectors are wider than standard centerpieces. This minimizes any error from lamp flash timing, while improving radial recording accuracy. Both sectors are mirror images of each other. Scanning in intensity mode allows each sector to be scanned as a separate image, and the calibration results from both sectors can be compared for agreement. Any disagreement between the two sector's edge positions indicate an alignment issue with the disk, and thus it can be used as a guide to correct the alignment notch of either the cell housing or the rotor. The edge positions of our design has been verified by scanning the disk on a high-resolution flatbed scanner. Using correct spacer rings, our disk can be positioned precisely in the focus position of the light path for optimal imaging accuracy of the edge positions. Specifically, the calibration disk is installed between two windows, and positioned in at 2/3 of the optical plane of the 1.2 cm AUC cell housing. Manufacturing Laser cutting, 3D printing, and CNC machining were all tested for the manufacturing of the disk. 3D printing was considered because it was previously used for centerpieces, 1 but was too imprecise and lacked sufficient rigidity at 0.5 mm thickness for our needs (see figure). Additionally, thicker material produced measurable issues with shading on one side of the edge, suggesting that the incident beam is not perfectly perpendicular to the focus plane. In the end, we found that CNC machining produced the most reproducible and accurate results. A Sherline 3 axis Bench Top CNC Mill with a tolerance of +- 0.0005 cm, featuring a solid carbide slotting end mill, were used to produce the calibration disks from 0.5 mm brass shim stock.

These forces can create hydro-static pressures up to 250 bar at the bottom of the solution column. Cells should allow for the passage of light through the cell, via quartz or sapphire windows, while the rotor is spinning. Components Each analytical cell that is used in the An-60 Ti and An-50 Ti rotors consist of a centerpiece, two window assemblies, and a cell housing. For cells with a 3-mm centerpiece, two spacers are required. Each component is designed with a special key on the housing, and a key-way on the other parts, which will all fit together to provide accurate alignment. Centerpieces The sector-shaped sample compartments that are used are essential in velocity experiments as the sedimenting particles will move along radial lines. If the components had parallel walls, the molecules would collide with the walls as they sediment. Table: Titanium Centerpiece Distributors \\[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\hline \\text{Channel Type} & \\text{Size} & \\text{Nanolytics GmbH} \\\\ \\hline \\text{2-channel} & \\text{12-mm} & \\text{810-12} \\\\ \\text{6-channel} & \\text{12-mm} & \\text{810} \\\\ \\text{2-channel} & \\text{3-mm} & \\text{810-03} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] Due to the weight of the centerpieces, cells must be used with a titanium centerpiece. For the 3-mm centerpieces, 2 spaces are required. Double Sector The sample solution can be placed in one sector, with the second sector for reference material (this sector is filled slightly more than the sample, so that the reference meniscus does not obscure profiles). Six-Channel Equilibrium Six-Channel Equilibrium (External Fill) Boundary Forming These cells allow the solvent to be laid over a sample while the cell is spinning at a moderately slow speed. These cells can prepare artificial sharp boundaries for measuring boundary spreading in measurements of diffusion coefficients, and for examining sedimentation velocity of small molecules (where the rate of sedimentation cannot create a sharp boundary to clear the meniscus). Band Forming There cells allow for the layering of a small volume of solution on the top of a supporting density gradient. 1 2 Windows Both quartz and sapphire windows can be used in the analytical cells. The window assembly components are compatible with both window types. Handle the windows with care. Do not scratch them; this immediately decommission them. Sapphire windows are specifically recommended to use with the interference optical system, as they allow for good fringe patterns at speeds above 30,000 rpm because they produce less light refraction. However, they can block the transmission of light below ~240 nm. The sapphire windows are heavier and harder than the quartz windows, and thus expected to have a longer life. They may have an \"x\" etched on the side to differentiate them. If not, use their weights to determine their type. Do not mix sapphire and quartz windows. \\[ \\begin{array}{l|cc} \\hline \\text{Property} & \\text{Quartz} & \\text{Sapphire} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Weight (g)} & \\text{3.76} & \\text{5.64} \\\\ \\text{Density (cm$^{-3}$)} & \\text{2.65} & \\text{3.98} \\\\ \\text{Optics} & \\text{Absorbance} & \\text{Interference } \\\\ & \\text{Fluorescence} & \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] It is very important for the quartz windows to have an absorbance of less than 0.1 AU in the 190 to 800 nm range. Check the absorbance yearly by: 1) cleaning the window and checking that it is clear and not damaged, and; 2) using a spectrophotometer to check the window absorbance. This is done by running a background wavelength scan fro 190 nm to 800 nm with nothing in the light's path. Now, place the window in the path of the light and scan the same wavelength range.

[\u2713] Screw-Ring Check that the screw-ring threads are clean and free of burs. The screw-ring washers should be clear, and not deformed. [\u2713] Window Holders Holders should not be distorted. The window gaskets should be clean, and the window liners should not be frayed at the edges. The window gasket should be checked and changed when it becomes transparent, indicating compression. The window liner is placed so that the open end is opposite of the alignment mark and the window inserted with the arrow lined up with the key-way. The window should fit snugly. If it does not, the liner should be changed. [\u2713] Windows Check the windows for any scratches or cracks. If necessary and the scratches/cracks are in areas that do not cover the sector, the windows can be used. Check that the windows are clean. There should not be any fingerprints, smudges, dust, or lint. Once they are clean, handle them with a lint-less tissue, holding them by the edges only. [\u2713] Centerpiece The centerpieces should have undamaged faces and septum walls. [\u2713] Housing Check that the cell-housing threads are clean, the housing key-way is not nicked, the filling holes are clean, and the housing itself is not deformed. [\u2713] Cell Weight When using more than 1 analytical cells, ensure that opposing cells contain the same type of centerpiece and are within 0.5 grams of each other. Once these inspections and checks are completed, the cell assembly can begin. STEP 1: Assemble Windows Insert a window gasket into the window holder. Place the liner in the holder, over the gasket. The gap in the liner should be opposite from the key-way. Think of the direction of force and how the liner cushions the window. Carefully insert the clean window into the holder. Repeat as necessary. STEP 2: Stack Centerpiece and Window Assemblies The bottom window assembly is pushed down to the bottom of the housing, window side up, aligning the key-way with they key,the centerpiece inserted part number right side up, and the top window assembly inserted. Stack the centerpiece and the final window assembly (window down), and push them down. For 3-mm centerpieces, a space must be inserted before the bottom window assembly. The second spacer is placed above the top window. Do not force any of the components down into the housing. If they do not slide down easily, check for anything that is hindering their movement. STEP 3: Insert Screw Ring into Housing and Tighten Place the screw ring gasket and screw ring into the top. The side inscribed \"OUT\" should be facing up. The screw ring can be manually turned, and then finished using a cell assembly tool. Remember that the screw has a buttress thread, and forcing the ring to screw in the wrong direction will strip the threads. Place the analytical cell into the cell torque collet. Torque to 125 pound inches. Do not over-torque, as this may lead to warping of the cell or crushing of the windows. Remove the torque from the collet and remove the cell from the vise only touching the housing. STEP 4: Fill Centerpieces and Seal Cells can be loaded using either a pipette or a syringe and tubing. Pipetting involves stacking a round, gel-loading tip into a 1000 \\(\\mu\\) l tip to load the 450 \\(\\mu\\) l of sample. Standard Double-Sector: Each sector can hold 0.46 mL. Hold the cell horizontally with the screw ring end facing you and the filling holes up. The reference sector is on the left; the right sector is for the sample-solvent mixture in Absorbance experiments. You can add a greater volume to the reference sector so that the meniscus is easily recognized. Six-Channel Equilibrium (External Fill): Synthetic Boundary (capillary-type): Band Forming: Once the samples are loaded, a small gasket must be placed over the hole and a small brass screw is placed overin the hole and tightened. The centrifugal force will push the gaskets into the fill holes to seal them. Over-tightening of the screw can cause warping to the cell housing and make it difficult to push into the rotor hole. General advice: air must be allowed to escape the chambers as fluid is pushed into the centerpiece; otherwise, fluid will spill out. Concentrated samples and those containing detergents may be difficult to load. Be continual and slow with your injection. STEP 5: Weigh Assembled Cells and Prepare Counterbalance Weigh your assembled cells. Opposing cells should weigh within 0.5 grams of each other. Match the weight of the cell that will be opposite to the counterbalance to the weight of the counterbalance. You can use weights to match. This is done by screwing the weight into the weight attachment hole at the top of the counterbalance. For a 0.5 gram weight, it can be screwed into the weight attachment hole at the bottom of the counterbalance. Do not have any weights protruding out of the top or bottom of the counterbalance. They should be flush; protruding weights can get sheared off during centrifugation. STEP 6: Load Rotor Place the counterbalance in its cell hole (cell 4 for An-60 Ti, cell 8 for An-50 Ti). The arrow on the counterbalance should be pointing away from the center of rotation. If the counterbalance is loose, use a small Allen wrench to tighten the setscrew. Install each assembled cell into their respective holes with the screw ring up, and the housing filling holes toward the center of the rotor. Match the scribe line on each cell with the scribe line on the rotor hole. Make sure the cell fits snugly into the cell hole. Finally, the rotor assembly can be placed on the spindle inside the chamber of the AUC, the proper optics installed, and placing the lid. With the last sliding door closed, the vacuum can be turned on. Disassembly Once a run has been complete, the cell disassembly process can begin. If you have a machine capable of cleaning the cells without disassembly, it is not necessary to take them apart. Otherwise the procedure is such: STEP 1: Remove Housing Screws and Gaskets. Unscrew and remove the housing gaskets. Remove the plug gaskets with forceps and discard them. Do not scratch the centerpiece. STEP 2: Remove Sample from Sectors. If necessary, cells with external filling holes can be emptied after the removal of the plug screws and gaskets, but before disassembling the entire cell. Generally, stable cells can be removed this way, making AUC a non-destructive analysis method. STEP 3: Loosen Screw-Ring. Loosen the screw-ring using the cell torque wrench. Remove the ring and washer. STEP 4: Remove Components. Place the cell threaded-end down. Push the components out by pressing them down with your finger, while lifting the housing up. STEP 5: Clean and Store Components. Push the windows out of the window holders, and thoroughly wash and dry all components. Clean and dry the centerpieces. Store all components in a dust-free environment. Cleaning Cell windows and centerpieces should be cleaned after every run. If hand-washing, disassemble the cell as described above. Centerpieces and windows can be rinsed with warm water. If you have access to an ultrasonic cleaner, they can be placed on the tray with mild detergent, such as LiquiNox, for 60 minutes. Otherwise, use milli-Q water, detergent, and ethanol to clean the components before allowing them to dry in a standing position on a lens paper/Kim wipe. Rinse the centerpieces thoroughly to remove all detergent. The windows can be gently polished with a lens paper before reassembly into the window holders. The cell housing can be wiped with a Kim Wipe dampened with WD-40. If cell leakage has occurred (see below), make sure to disassembly the entire cell and clean all components in a mild detergent solution. Rinse the cleaned components and dry them thoroughly to prevent corrosion. Spin Analytical provides a AUC Cell Washer that is a simple, stand alone, fault tolerant device for washing AUC cells without time consuming disassembly and reassembly. For information, click here . Leakage Cell leakage is a possible issue that may occur when running an AUC experiment. Massive leaks where the sample leaves the cell will cause a temporary loss in chamber vacuum. This will be reported as a diagnostic message on the display screen of the instrument. This is one indication of cell leakage. Another is from observing incoming data scans; the meniscus will shift/disappear toward the cell bottom as sample leaves. Filling Hole Leaks These leaks result from the fill hole gaskets not completely sealing the holes. Leaks Across the Face of Centerpiece These leaks are a result of scratches on the centerpiece or windows, or from inadequate tightening of the cell housing/screw ring. Sector to Sector Leaks These leaks occur only when the fill levels differ by more than 5 \\(\\mu\\) l. This is indicated by meniscus shifting or disappearing. Keep in mind that similar fill volumes reduces the stress of the wall between the sectors, minimizing damage and leaking. In the six-channel centerpieces, leaking can occur between channels in the direction of the centrifugal force. This is identified by a change in the position of the meniscus. If leakage is due to a damaged centerpiece, replace the centerpiece and discard the damaged piece. Counterbalances The counterbalance is typically coloured anodized red, and must be positioned in hole 4 for the An-60 Ti rotor, and hole 8 for the An-50 Ti rotor. The counterbalance features set screws, center screw holes for weights, and inner and outer reference holes. Mask sets are inserted into these reference hold, one of which is wider that the other - this set should face the outside of the rotor. To balance the opposing cell, the counterbalance will come with weights. Ensure that the weight is within 0.5 grams of the opposing cell. Only a 0.5 g weight can be added to the bottom center screw hole. All other weights are added on the top screw hole. A small setscrew in the top of the counterbalance can be used to secure the counterbalance in the rotor. Align the counterbalance using the tick marks on the rotor and the counterbalance housing and then tighten the screw to hold it in position. For radial calibrations, the instrument will use the absorbance optics to look at the dark and light areas of the counterbalance. The edges in the mask are at 5.85 cm on the inside and 7.15 cm on the outside. Radial calibration of the interference optics is done manually. Cohen, R. and Mire, M.

For cells with a 3-mm centerpiece, two spacers are required. Each component is designed with a special key on the housing, and a key-way on the other parts, which will all fit together to provide accurate alignment. Centerpieces The sector-shaped sample compartments that are used are essential in velocity experiments as the sedimenting particles will move along radial lines.

For the 3-mm centerpieces, 2 spaces are required. Double Sector The sample solution can be placed in one sector, with the second sector for reference material (this sector is filled slightly more than the sample, so that the reference meniscus does not obscure profiles). Six-Channel Equilibrium Six-Channel Equilibrium (External Fill) Boundary Forming These cells allow the solvent to be laid over a sample while the cell is spinning at a moderately slow speed. These cells can prepare artificial sharp boundaries for measuring boundary spreading in measurements of diffusion coefficients, and for examining sedimentation velocity of small molecules (where the rate of sedimentation cannot create a sharp boundary to clear the meniscus). Band Forming There cells allow for the layering of a small volume of solution on the top of a supporting density gradient. 1 2 Windows Both quartz and sapphire windows can be used in the analytical cells. The window assembly components are compatible with both window types. Handle the windows with care. Do not scratch them; this immediately decommission them. Sapphire windows are specifically recommended to use with the interference optical system, as they allow for good fringe patterns at speeds above 30,000 rpm because they produce less light refraction. However, they can block the transmission of light below ~240 nm. The sapphire windows are heavier and harder than the quartz windows, and thus expected to have a longer life. They may have an \"x\" etched on the side to differentiate them. If not, use their weights to determine their type. Do not mix sapphire and quartz windows. \\[ \\begin{array}{l|cc} \\hline \\text{Property} & \\text{Quartz} & \\text{Sapphire} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Weight (g)} & \\text{3.76} & \\text{5.64} \\\\ \\text{Density (cm$^{-3}$)} & \\text{2.65} & \\text{3.98} \\\\ \\text{Optics} & \\text{Absorbance} & \\text{Interference } \\\\ & \\text{Fluorescence} & \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] It is very important for the quartz windows to have an absorbance of less than 0.1 AU in the 190 to 800 nm range.

[\u2713] Screw-Ring Check that the screw-ring threads are clean and free of burs. The screw-ring washers should be clear, and not deformed. [\u2713] Window Holders Holders should not be distorted. The window gaskets should be clean, and the window liners should not be frayed at the edges. The window gasket should be checked and changed when it becomes transparent, indicating compression. The window liner is placed so that the open end is opposite of the alignment mark and the window inserted with the arrow lined up with the key-way. The window should fit snugly. If it does not, the liner should be changed. [\u2713] Windows Check the windows for any scratches or cracks. If necessary and the scratches/cracks are in areas that do not cover the sector, the windows can be used. Check that the windows are clean. There should not be any fingerprints, smudges, dust, or lint. Once they are clean, handle them with a lint-less tissue, holding them by the edges only. [\u2713] Centerpiece The centerpieces should have undamaged faces and septum walls. [\u2713] Housing Check that the cell-housing threads are clean, the housing key-way is not nicked, the filling holes are clean, and the housing itself is not deformed. [\u2713] Cell Weight When using more than 1 analytical cells, ensure that opposing cells contain the same type of centerpiece and are within 0.5 grams of each other. Once these inspections and checks are completed, the cell assembly can begin. STEP 1: Assemble Windows Insert a window gasket into the window holder. Place the liner in the holder, over the gasket. The gap in the liner should be opposite from the key-way. Think of the direction of force and how the liner cushions the window. Carefully insert the clean window into the holder. Repeat as necessary. STEP 2: Stack Centerpiece and Window Assemblies The bottom window assembly is pushed down to the bottom of the housing, window side up, aligning the key-way with they key,the centerpiece inserted part number right side up, and the top window assembly inserted. Stack the centerpiece and the final window assembly (window down), and push them down. For 3-mm centerpieces, a space must be inserted before the bottom window assembly. The second spacer is placed above the top window. Do not force any of the components down into the housing. If they do not slide down easily, check for anything that is hindering their movement. STEP 3: Insert Screw Ring into Housing and Tighten Place the screw ring gasket and screw ring into the top. The side inscribed \"OUT\" should be facing up. The screw ring can be manually turned, and then finished using a cell assembly tool. Remember that the screw has a buttress thread, and forcing the ring to screw in the wrong direction will strip the threads. Place the analytical cell into the cell torque collet. Torque to 125 pound inches. Do not over-torque, as this may lead to warping of the cell or crushing of the windows. Remove the torque from the collet and remove the cell from the vise only touching the housing. STEP 4: Fill Centerpieces and Seal Cells can be loaded using either a pipette or a syringe and tubing. Pipetting involves stacking a round, gel-loading tip into a 1000 \\(\\mu\\) l tip to load the 450 \\(\\mu\\) l of sample. Standard Double-Sector: Each sector can hold 0.46 mL. Hold the cell horizontally with the screw ring end facing you and the filling holes up. The reference sector is on the left; the right sector is for the sample-solvent mixture in Absorbance experiments. You can add a greater volume to the reference sector so that the meniscus is easily recognized. Six-Channel Equilibrium (External Fill): Synthetic Boundary (capillary-type): Band Forming: Once the samples are loaded, a small gasket must be placed over the hole and a small brass screw is placed overin the hole and tightened. The centrifugal force will push the gaskets into the fill holes to seal them. Over-tightening of the screw can cause warping to the cell housing and make it difficult to push into the rotor hole. General advice: air must be allowed to escape the chambers as fluid is pushed into the centerpiece; otherwise, fluid will spill out. Concentrated samples and those containing detergents may be difficult to load. Be continual and slow with your injection. STEP 5: Weigh Assembled Cells and Prepare Counterbalance Weigh your assembled cells. Opposing cells should weigh within 0.5 grams of each other. Match the weight of the cell that will be opposite to the counterbalance to the weight of the counterbalance. You can use weights to match. This is done by screwing the weight into the weight attachment hole at the top of the counterbalance. For a 0.5 gram weight, it can be screwed into the weight attachment hole at the bottom of the counterbalance. Do not have any weights protruding out of the top or bottom of the counterbalance. They should be flush; protruding weights can get sheared off during centrifugation. STEP 6: Load Rotor Place the counterbalance in its cell hole (cell 4 for An-60 Ti, cell 8 for An-50 Ti). The arrow on the counterbalance should be pointing away from the center of rotation. If the counterbalance is loose, use a small Allen wrench to tighten the setscrew. Install each assembled cell into their respective holes with the screw ring up, and the housing filling holes toward the center of the rotor. Match the scribe line on each cell with the scribe line on the rotor hole. Make sure the cell fits snugly into the cell hole. Finally, the rotor assembly can be placed on the spindle inside the chamber of the AUC, the proper optics installed, and placing the lid. With the last sliding door closed, the vacuum can be turned on.","title":"Assembly"},{"location":"cells/#disassembly","text":"Once a run has been complete, the cell disassembly process can begin. If you have a machine capable of cleaning the cells without disassembly, it is not necessary to take them apart. Otherwise the procedure is such: STEP 1: Remove Housing Screws and Gaskets. Unscrew and remove the housing gaskets. Remove the plug gaskets with forceps and discard them. Do not scratch the centerpiece. STEP 2: Remove Sample from Sectors. If necessary, cells with external filling holes can be emptied after the removal of the plug screws and gaskets, but before disassembling the entire cell. Generally, stable cells can be removed this way, making AUC a non-destructive analysis method. STEP 3: Loosen Screw-Ring. Loosen the screw-ring using the cell torque wrench. Remove the ring and washer. STEP 4: Remove Components. Place the cell threaded-end down. Push the components out by pressing them down with your finger, while lifting the housing up.

An analytical ultracentrifuge can 'watch' molecules while they are seperating and indentify and differentiate them by their hydrodynamic properties and partial concentration. AUC works by applying a centrifugal force, causing molecules to become seperated based on their bouyant mass and their frictional properties. The molecules can be observed using different optical systems that detect the different properites of the molecules. Virtually any molecule, colloid, or particle that can be dissolved in a liquid can be measured by AUC, as long as it does not sediment by gravity alone. The molecule or particle can be as small as a salt ion, or as large as an entire virus particle. EXAMPLE: Determine Sedimentation Coefficient Consider an initially homogenous solution.

SOLUTION: Lorem Ipsum EXAMPLE: Determining a Protein's Molecular Weight Consider a protein that is ran in a rotor at a speed of 12,000 rpm at 4-degrees C. It is in a dilute aqueous buffer whose density is that of water.

Solution: M = 57,800 Da When a solute is suspended in a solent, it is subject to several different forces. First, we have the sedimenting/graviational force. This force is proportional to the mass of the particle and the acceleration is it experiencing. When considering a spinning rotor, this is the centrifugal force: \\[ F_{c} = \\frac{mv_{tang}^{2}}{r} = m r \\omega^{2}. \\] Here, \\(r\\) is the distance from the axis of rotation (cm), \\(v_{tang}\\) is the linear velocity perpendicular to the radial axis (m/s \\(^{2}\\) ), and \\(\\omega\\) is the angular velocity (radians/second). \\[\\bf{Remember:~~~ 1 ~RPM = \\frac{2\\pi}{60} ~rad/sec.}\\] We can write it in terms of molar weight, \\(M\\) (g/mol), and Avogadro's number, \\(N\\) . \\[ F_{c} = \\frac{M}{N}\\omega^{2}r. \\] DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CENTRIFUGAL AND CENTRIPETAL: Centrifugal: in the rotating reference frame of the rotor.

Then, F_{g} = \\frac{G m_e m}{r_{e}^{2}}, with \\(G = 6.67 \\times 10^{-8}\\) cm \\(^{3}\\) /sec \\(^{2}\\) is the universal gravitational constant. <span style=\"color: #d9534f;\"EXAMPLE: Determine Centrifugal Force at Radius, r Consider a rotor spinning at 45,000 rpm. What is its centrifugal force at a radius of 5 cm? Write as a multiple of the gravitational force.

Sedimentation occurs when the density of the particle is greater than that of the solvent. As the solute moves towards the bottom of the cell, it will expereince an increase in velocity, due to the increasing radial distance (the force is proportional to radius). As it moves through the fluid, the solute will experience a frictional drag proportional to its velocity. The frictional force is: \\[ F_{f} = -f v \\] where \\(f\\) is the frictional coefficent. This coefficent is dependent on the shape and size of the solute: bulky or elongated particles will experience a greater fricitonal drag compared to the drag expereinced by compact, smooth spherical particles. The negative sign in the equations for buoyancy and frictional drag indicate that these forces are acting opposite to the sedimentation force. As the rotor is spun up, the forces aboce will come into balance: \\[ \\sum F = F_{c} + F_{b} + F_{f} = 0, \\] \\[ \\frac{M}{N}\\omega^{2} - \\frac{M}{N} \\bar\\nu\\rho\\omega^{2}r - f v = 0, \\] \\[ \\frac{M}{N}(1-\\bar\\nu\\rho)\\omega^{2}r - fu = 0. \\] Let us now create the term \\(v/\\omega^{2}r\\) to represent the sedimentation coefficient, or the velocity of a particle per unit of gravitational acceleration. \\[ \\frac{M(1-\\bar\\nu\\rho)}{Nf} = \\frac{v}{\\omega^{2}r} \\equiv s. \\] Note how this coefficient is proportional to the buoyant effective molar weight and is inversely proportional to the frictional coefficient. The sedimentation coefficent has dimensions of seconds, \\(s\\) , and the Svedberg unit, \\(S\\) , is defined at 10 \\(^{-13}\\) seconds. As sedimentation piles the solutes at the bottom of the cell, the concentration at that point will increase, and the process of diffusion will oppose further sedimentation. After an appropriate amount of time, diffusion and sedimentation will approach an equilibrium point and the concentration of the solute will have an exponential increase towards the bottom of the cell. The concentration distribution from the top of the cell to the bottom will no longer change over time and is now a function of molecular weight.

Total radial deviations ranged between 40 \\(\\mu\\) m- 380 \\(\\mu\\) m. At the greatest deviation, 380 \\(\\mu\\) m, the error contributed to as much as 0.66% in the measure of the sedimentation coefficient. The largest errors occur near the top of the cell, decreasing towards the bottom. This means several things: first, the absolute measurement is incorrect, and; secondly, the radial deviation contributes to an apparently non-constant \\(s\\) value. Causes While the exact cause is not precisely known, these deviations are likely a result of imperfections in the AUC's optical system, specifically the non-vertical light beam tracing. The lack of perpendicular incident light is supported by the appearance of shadows on one side of the calibration disk's edges. As shown below in \\(\\textbf{Figure 1}\\) , the shadow produces a zig-zag effect on the deviations from the predicted positions. There is additionally a wavelength-dependent variability in the radial scaling between the top and bottom of the cell. There is a change in the absolute deviation when the inner edge deviations are compared with the outer edge deviations, with the lower wavelength producing a higher magnitude of total offset. \\(\\textbf{Figure 1}\\) Edge position deviations from predicted positions for observations made at: 200 nm (black), 230 nm (red), 300 nm (green), 460 nm (blue), and 750 nm (magenta). \\(\\textbf{Table 1}\\) Edge positions in cm at rest versus predicted, measured at 250 nm. \\[\\begin{array}{llll} \\hline \\text{Edge} & \\text{Measured (cm)} & \\text{Predicated (cm)} & \\text{Difference (cm)} \\\\ \\hline 1 & 5.94974 & 5.929 & -2.07E-02 \\\\ 2 & 6.05122 & 6.025 & ??2.62E-02\\\\ 3 & 6.11951 & 6.097 & ??2.25E-02\\\\ 4 & 6.26084 & 6.237 & ??2.38E-02\\\\ 5 & 6.32905 & 6.308 & ??2.11E-02\\\\ 6 & 6.44025 & 6.425 & ??1.53E-02\\\\ 7 & 6.56951 & 6.550 & ??1.95E-02\\\\ 8 & 6.67923 & 6.658 & ??2.12E-02\\\\ 9 & 6.74475 & 6.728 & ??1.68E-02\\\\ 10 & 6.88611 & 6.868 & ??1.81E-02\\\\ 11 & 6.95078 & 6.939 & ??1.18E-02\\\\ 12 & 7.09261 & 7.077 &??1.56E-02\\\\ 13 & 7.15398 & 7.146 & ??7.98E-03 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\\] Stoutjesdyk, M., Henrickson, A., Minors, G., Demeler, B.

European Biophysics Journal , 49 (8). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00249-020-01434-z Correction Methods A calibration curve based on the shift in edge position as a function of wavelength can be constructed to correct for the wavelength-dependent variations. Another correction method involves measuring the position of a meniscus over the wavelength range. In this method, the meniscus positions of 4-8 samples filled with 0.23 ml of water can be repeatedly scanned in intensity mode at 62 wavelengths, spanning 190 nm to 800 nm in 10 nm intervals. The optimal rotor speed is 14,000 rpm, since at that speed, the scanning time is minimized due to the synchronization with the flash rate of the flash lamp. The following is the recommended procedure for how to build a calibration file from using the meniscus position method. A pdf version of this protocol is available here . Import the Calibration Data into UltraScan's Utilities: View Raw Optima Data module. Zoom on the meniscus region for each channel while in intensity mode. For each channel, a csv file will be generated into the UltraScan imports data folder. This dataset maps the radial position of the meniscus minima against wavelength. Use a third party spreadsheet program to average the meniscus positions. Subtract the 250 nm value from each wavelengths radial position. The 250 nm position is assumed to be correct if the instrument has been radially calibrated with the manufacturer's counterbalance at that wavelength. Assume this position to be the true offset with zero correction. Fit the averaged data with a parameterizing curve (with 1 nm increments).

DOI: 10.1002/ppsc.202100079 REWRITE: Determining the amount of drug loaded into a LNP is of utmost importance for many biopharma applications. Determining the precise loading with nucleic acids is critical for achieving clinically relevant formulations, and to avoid antigenic materials in vaccines or gene therapy formulations. This can be challenging for many techniques since overall LNP size and shape may not proportionally change with the cargo load. However, the density, or partical specific volume of LNPs is a sensitive predictor of loading state, regardless of particle size, and the absorbance profiles of liposomes and nucleic acids is a unique characteristic that can be followed by AUC. REWRITE: SVEs can be used to determine the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients, and partial concentrations of all solutes present in a sample with high resolution. In this workshop we will demonstrate how multiple SVEs performed in different D2O:H2O ratios can be used to globally fit a partial specific volume (PSV) distribution for samples that are heterogeneous in density, and to combine this information with MW-AUC information to uniquely identify the LNP loading state. Furthermore, we can combine the PSV distributions with the corresponding sedimentation and diffusion coefficient distributions to derive accurate molar mass, particle size and anisotropy distributions.

PLoS ONE . https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126420 What are Good Manufacturing Practices? Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) are a set of operating and instrument standards which dictate a processes control requirements and documentation. GMP environments provide assurances to the consumer and any regulatory agencies that: best practices were followed; results are validated, and can be audited; quality standards are observed, and; any risks are minimized throughout the procedure. Specifically, the criteria that must be met for GMP validation include: [\u2713] Audit trail for any transation on data and results [\u2713] Reproducibility needs to be assured as much as possible [\u2713] Control as many parameters as possible [\u2713] Restricted access to data, experimental procedures [\u2713] Validated standards for comparison [\u2713] Validate instrument operation and functions GMP Obstacles in AUC Within the AUC lab, there are several issues that can be determined which affect the authenticity of data analysis procedures. Human error can be found in the form of the manual process of sample handling and AUC cell loading. There is a certain dexterity that is required to achieve reproducible loading volumes, as well as proper alignment of cells in the rotor. There are a large number of operational variables which would need individual validation, before their effect on results can be minimized. There is weakness in the chain of data custody. This impairs the audit trail, and can allow for potential manipulation/falsification of primary research data. For example, the traditional data acquisition software is disconnected from the analysis process, and thus requires manual data transfer between multiple computers. Traditional data acquisition is performed on undocumented software. This software is often closed-source freeware, preventing any source code auditing, leaving no assurances for the users that the software follows any stringent GMP documentation requirements. Important parameters are not routinely checked for consistency. Resolution information content is affected by: number of scans in the experiment, duration of experiment, loading volume, and column length. Loading concentration can affect the mass action of reversible systems and non-ideality parameters. Chromatic aberration can cause incorrect radial reporting when recording wavelengths. Data quality is not checked for consistency. Data editing, analysis algorithms, and analysis parameters can be left up to an user to change at will. Data interpretation is affected by analysis parameters (grid size, grid resolution, edited data ranges, buffer corrections) and hardware parameters (rotor stretch corrections). Reporting is not an automated process. The processing of data is manual and based on a subjective interpretation of results. That interpretation does not necessarily include standard metrics for comparison that can be automated and applied without user bias. Parameters Subject to Error A recent multi-labratory study demonstrated the importance of accurate reference materials to provide improved validation for the AUC. 1 Accurate reference materials are also useful in that they will complement the resolution gains offered by modern analysis software. The following hardware components of the AUC instrument have been found to affect analysis results. Cell Component Quality Chromatic Aberration While investigating the accuracy of radial recordings made on the Optima AUC, it was noted that there was the presence of wavelength dependence on the radial positions collected as a result of chromatic aberration, a phenomenon related to the variability of refraction at different wavelengths. Electric Power Supply Stability Optics: Light Intensity, Alignment, Force Integrals Radial Calibrations Record Time and Centrifugal Force Integrals Rotor Speed Stretching or Contracting of the Rotor in Response to Speed Changes What is rotor stretching and how do we know it is occuring? We noticed that the Lamm Equation was being solved with incorrect boundary conditions. Typically, we expect the bottom of the cell to be routinely held constant at the known position at rest. However, the absolute radial position of the sample cell was shifting. Finite element solutions of the Lamm Equation require accurate knowledge of the boundary consitions, which include the radial positions of the meniscus and bottom location ofthe sample cell. Any error in these boundary conditions, or the absolute radial positionscollected will affect the fitte values of the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients. This error propogates to the calculations of biomolecular attributes. Stretching or contracting of the rotor changes these boundary conditions, and thus must be known. Specifically, the titanium rotors, when spun at very high speeds, were stretching a finite amount, changing the boundary conditions of the experiment compared to those at rest or a different speed. Consider the figure: this is a temperture-time graph for a rotor spinning from rest to 60,000 RPM, resting for 15 mins, and then decelerating back down to rest. Notice how there is a temperature decrease intially as the rotor accelerates; the acceleration period takes ~5 minutes. As the speed increases the rotor needs energy to stretch out and so it takes it from its environment. The chamber will notice this change and correct the temperature to the stated temperature. This correction occurs while to rotor spins at 60,000 RPM for 15 minutes. After this time has elapsed, the rotor spins down to rest and no longer needs the heat energy it took from the environment and so it releases it, causing an increases in temperature. Again, the chamber will correct for this change. The valley and peak have approximately the same area, and this change in temperature is adiabatic.

Raman Scattering vs. Fluoresence Describe a way (either steady-state or time-resolved) to distinguish Raman scattering from fluorescence. Using ladder and Feynman diagrams for fluorescence (F) and Raman Scattering (R). We define the ground state by \\(\\ket{1}\\bra{1}\\) , the vibrationally excited state (VES) by \\(\\ket{2}\\bra{2}\\) , and the electroniclly excited state (EES) by \\(\\ket{1'}\\bra{1'}\\) . Generally, both fluorescence and Raman scattering can be explain in two interactions, as shown in the figure on the right. There will be some incident light, \\(\\omega_1\\) , which will excite an electron from the ground state to the EES. Spontaneous emission occurs in the form of \\(\\omega_2\\) when there is a transition from the EES to the VES. in fluorescence, \\(\\omega_2\\) can be refered to as the fluorescence frequency; in Raman scattering, \\(\\omega_2\\) is known as the scattered frequency. Note that in both fluorescence and Raman scattering, the direction of \\(\\omega_2\\) will be random (the phton will be emitted in all directions in space). The figures directly below is a representation of four interactions in the form of ladder diagrams and Feynman diagrams. To help with understanding these diagrams, reference this table: For Raman scattering specifically, we have intensities, \\(\\omega_1, \\omega_2\\) , which are sometimes referred to as the 'pump' and 'probe', respectively. The order of interactions are: \\[ \\omega_1 \\rightarrow \\omega_1^* \\rightarrow \\omega_2 \\rightarrow \\omega_2^* \\] During stimulated Raman emission, these interactions essentially amoun to losing the 'pump' photon and gaining a 'probe' photon. For fluorescence, the order of interaction is: \\[ \\omega_1 \\rightarrow \\omega_2 \\rightarrow \\omega_1^* \\rightarrow \\omega_2^* \\] We know that if the energy of a photon is greater or equal to the differene between the ground state and the excited state (it is resonant with a molecular transition), the molecule can absorb that photon and undergo a transition. In this excited state, the molecule has several options: it may lose some or all of its energy in an interaction with another molecules; it may fall apart if the extra energy is too much, or; it may emit the extra energy as a photon. This last case is known as fluorescence and is the result of that resonant process. Raman scattering, on the other hand, is not a resonant process. Rather, the energy of the photon is not of particular importance. A molecule will recieve EM radiation and re-radiate it This will typically be at the same energy needed for Rayleigh scattergin. Sometimes some of the energy is stored as molecular vibrational energy, and if the molecule is already in an vibrationally excited state, the energy will be emitted as a photon, with the scattered light seeing a shift in the wavelength from its incident EM radiation. This is demonstrated below. We can therefore seee that there is incident light in the form of \\(\\omega_1\\) acting on the ket bind to turn the \\(\\ket{1}\\) coherence into the \\(\\ket{1'}\\) EES coherence. The imaginary component, \\(\\omega_1^*\\) , is emitted to turn the \\(\\ket{1'}\\) coherence into the VES coherence, \\(\\ket{2}\\) . The state at this point is now \\(\\ket{2}\\bra{1}\\) . There is no population of the EES. Instead, there is coherence between the two VESs, \\(\\ket{1}\\bra{1}\\) and \\(\\ket{2}\\bra{2}\\) . Lorem Ipsum... Additionally, it may be useful to think of these situations in their density matrix representations. For fluorescence and Raman scattering, respectively, we have: \\[ \\hat\\rho_F = \\ket{1}\\bra{1} \\rightarrow \\ket{1'}\\bra{1} \\rightarrow \\ket{1'}\\bra{1'} \\rightarrow \\ket{2}\\bra{1'} \\rightarrow \\ket{1}\\bra{1} \\] \\[ \\hat\\rho_R = \\ket{1}\\bra{1} \\rightarrow \\ket{1'}\\bra{1} \\rightarrow \\ket{2}\\bra{1} \\rightarrow \\ket{2}\\bra{1'} \\rightarrow\\ket{1}\\bra{1} \\] Note that there is only one difference betweeen the F and R density matrices in the fourth matrix element. For fluorescence, this element implies no vibrational coherence with a total population of the EESs. For Raman scattering, this element implies coherence between the VESs, and no populations of the EESs. Fluoresnce Emission Spectrum of Proteins Using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, you can measure the fluorescence emission spec- trum of a protein, which binds to DNA depending upon the concentration of the small nucleotide cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The protein has a single tryptophan and one tyrosine and forms a dimer at saturating concentrations of cAMP. Please explain the following observations: (a) In the native, ligand-free state (i.e., no cAMP and no DNA), the fluorescence emission has a maximum at 330 nm. (b) When cAMP is bound, the emission maximum shifts to 325 nm. (c) When the protein is folded in 8 M urea, the emission maximum shifts to 350 nm. Suggest one or two experiments to test your explanations. First, let us discuss tryptophan (Trp) and tyrosine (Tyr). Trp is more fluorescence compared to Tyr. Its fluorescence properties are solvent dependent, in that the spectrum will shift to shorter wavelengths, and increase in intensity, as the polarity of the solvent decreases. Tyr is excited at similar wavelengths as Trp, but will emit at different wavelengths. Tyr is also less fluorescent than Trp. At 280 nm, both Trp and Tyr will be excited; to excite Trp only a wavelength of 295 nm is needed. Now, in the native folded state, both Trp and Tyr will be generally located in the core of the protein. In the unfolded state, or partially folded state, Trp and Tyr will become exposed to the solvent. Therefore, we can make the assumption that in the native, ligand-free state the fluorescence emission has an emission peak at 330 nm due to the fact that Trp and Tyr are both in the hydrophobic environment of the protein. In this medium, the relative polarity is low. When Trp and Tyr are moved into a hydrophilic environment due to binding of cAMP, for example, the relative polarity shifts to medium or high. This shift in polarity lowers the emission wavelength. For the situation where the protein is folding in 8 M urea, there will be denaturing of the proteins, such that hydrophobic parts will become exposed. Essentially, the urea will cause the proteins to fold more loosely, which will effect the emission wavelength by increasing it. For experiments, I propose determining the level of polarity of each of the situations, since I made the assumption that the polarity was the main factor affecting the emission maximum. Additionally, I would suggest determining the emission spectrum at different concentrations of cAMP. Fluoresence Correlation Spectroscopy Curves The cAMP-binding protein in the presence of saturating concentrations of cAMP forms a dimer that can bind to a specific site on a 100 base-pair DNA oligo (K d = 2 nM). You decide to study the protein-DNA interaction using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). You can generate a single Cys mutant and label it with Alexa-488- a small fluorophore excited by 488-nm light. Draw and label FCS curves appropriately scaled for the following situations: Diffusion of 5 nM protein dimer (saturating cAMP). 5 nM dimer + cAMP after the addition of 100 nM DNA (100 base-pair oligo with specific dimer site). Diffusion of 1 nM dimer (saturating cAMP). 1 nM dimer + cAMP after the addition of 100 nM DNA (100 base-pair oligo with specific dimer binding site). In fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), changes in the fluorescence in- tensity reflect concentration fluctuations. The auto-correlation of a system evaluates the temporal progression around the system\u2019s equilibrium, and reveals the time required for a molecule to diffuse through a particular volume. The amplitude of the auto-correlation function is influenced by the number of molecules that are detectable. The auto-correlation function can consist of multiple sigmoid components due to multiple signal fluctuations on different time scales. Slow fluctuations of fluorescence intensity demonstrate a slow diffusion over a longer time scale; rapid fluctuations indicate a faster diffusion over a shorter time scale for a particle with a large diffusion coefficient. Essentially, an increase in the diffusion coefficient will correspond to a decrease in the time scale for the auto-correlation function to fall by half. FCS can be used to monitor binding. Because there is more than one species within the solution, we should expect two sigmoid components, one for the free molecules, and one for the bounded molecules. We should also consider that since the amplitude of the auto-correlation function depends on the inverse of the average number of molecules. Thus, we should expect that a FCS curve for the situation with only protein will have a greater amplitude than the situation with dimer and DNA. FCS curves for situations 1 (blue) and 3 (black). Since the amplitude of \\(G(\\tau)\\) depends on \\(1/N\\) , we should expect to see the situation with 1 nM dimer to have the greatest amplitude. FCS curves for situations 2 (blue) and 4 (black). Since there are 3 species present (protein dimer, cAMP, and oligo), we should expect to see three sigmoids. Fret Relationships Assume that a FRET donor D has a single exponential decay in the absence of ac- ceptor A and that the orientation factor is \\(\u03ba_2\\) = 2/3. Draw fluorescence decay curves (log of intensity vs time) for the following situations (label and provide explanations): D to A distance = \\(R_0\\) ; r = \\(R_0\\) . D to A distance >> \\(R_0\\) ; r = 1.5 \\(R_0\\) . D to A distance << \\(R_0\\) ; r = 0.5 \\(R_0\\) . (Figure was taken from \"Basics of FRET Microscopy\" .) Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) involves a donor molecule in an excited electronic state and an acceptor molecule that can accept the transferred excitation energy from the donor, typically through dipole-dipole coupling. The dipole-dipole coupling can be described as an interaction dependent on the overlap of the emission spectrum of the donor molecule, and the absorption spectrum of the acceptor molecule. This overlap is represented by the figure on the right, and it dictates if there will be an energy transfer between the molecules. The energy transfer efficiency between the two molecules will decrease proportionally to the distance, \\(r\\) , that is seperating them. The rate of energy transfer is: \\[ k_r = \\frac{1}{\\tau_D}\\left(\\frac{R_0}{r} \\right )^6 \\] where \\(\\tau_D\\) is the donar lifetime in the absence of the acceptor, and \\(R_0\\) is the Forster distance. FRET efficiency is: \\[ E_{FRET} = \\left[1 + \\frac{r}{R_0}\\right]^{-6} \\] Now, the relative distances between the donors and acceptors is not uniform; rather, it follows the following distribution function: \\[ E_{FRET} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}{f(r)} \\left[1 + \\frac {r}{R_0}\\right]^{-6} dr \\] where \\(f(r)\\) is the normalized distribution of the donor-acceptor distances. Finally, the intensity of the fluorescence for detected excited molecules can be expressed by: \\[ I(t) = k \\int_{0}^{\\infty}f(r) ~\\text{exp}\\left[-\\frac{t}{\\tau} - \\frac{t}{\\tau}\\left(\\frac{R_0}{r} \\right)^6 \\right ] \\] Using this equation, we can determine the fluorescence decay curves, shown below. For simplicity, we assume \\(k=1\\) , and \\(f(r) = 1\\) . We will also set \\(x=t/\\tau\\) amd \\(d = R_0/r\\) , such that: \\[ f(x,d) = ~\\text{exp}(-x-xd^6), \\] which can then be ploted for the varying D values. (See also: A. Grinvald, E. Haas, and I. Z.

First, let us consider the \\(translational~frictional~coefficitent,~ f_{t}\\) : \\[ \\bf{F}_{f} = -f_{t}\\bf{v}. \\] This equation represents the porportionality constant between the velocity of a particle, \\(\\bf{v}\\) , and the frictional force that resists that motion, \\(\\bf{F}_{f}\\) .

This equation represents the proportionality constant between the angular velocity of the particle, \\(\\omega\\) , and the frictional torque that resists that motion, \\(\\bf{T}_{r}\\) .

When in a solution, the \\(\\bar\\nu\\) value will inclue the bound solvent that migrates with the molecule in a sedimentation or diffusion experiment. The partial specific volume is \\(\\bf{\\text{highly solvent dependent}}\\) . The particle always carries along a solvation shell (adding to its size). The shell also changes the density, and because the size has change, the friction also changes. PSV is quite hard to compute experimentally. For nucleic acids, for example, the estimation of \\(\\bar\\nu\\) is complicated by the fact that the PSV depends on: base composition; secondary structure; solvation; concentration of buffer ions, and; identity of buffer ions. The complicity of calculating PSV is shown in the equation below, which expresses how PSV is intimately related to the statistical-mechanical formulation of excess volume caused by the insertion of the solute into the solvent: \\[ \\bar\\nu = v_{s} + \\delta_{w}(\\nu_{w}-\\nu_{0}), \\] where \\(v_{s}\\) is the anhydrous solute volume, \\(\\delta\\) _{w} is the number of waters in the hydration layer, \\(v_{w}\\) is the PSV of the water in the hydration later, and \\(v_{0}\\) is the PSV of the water in the bulk. Intrinsic Viscosity Macromolecules can alter the viscosity of a solvent. Linear polymers produce the greatest effects (unfolded polypeptide chains, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates). Suppose we have a pure solvent with viscosity, \\(\\eta_{0}\\) , and a macromolecule of concentration, \\(c\\) . The \\(\\bf{\\text{measured viscosity}}\\) would then be: \\[ \\eta = \\eta_{0}(1 + k_{1}c + k_{2}c^{2} + ... + k_{n}c^{n}). \\] The \\(\\bf{\\text{relative viscosity}}\\) will be the ratio of measured to solvent viscosity: \\[ \\eta_{rel} = \\eta/\\eta_{0} = 1 + k_{1}c + k_{2}c^{2} + ... + k_{n}c^{n}. \\] The \\(\\bf{\\text{specific viscosity}}\\) is a measure of the effect the macromolecule has: \\[ \\eta_{sp} = eta_{rel} - 1 = k_{1}c + k_{2}c^{2} + ... + k_{n}c^{n}. \\] Therefore, when apprximated to the first order, the \\(\\bf{\\text{intrinsic viscosity}}\\) is then: \\[ [\\eta] = \\lim_{c \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\eta_{sp}}{c} = \\lim_{c \\rightarrow 0} (k_{1} + k_{2} + ... + k_{n}c^{n-1}) = k_{1}. \\] The intrinsic viscosity will have units of cm \\(^{3}\\) /g. Note that intrinsic viscosity is not sensitive to molecular weight, but rather, it is exquisitely sensitive to the shape of the molecule. For example, consider a macromolecule that is a hydrated sphere. The intrinsic vicosity can be written as: \\[ [\\eta] = 2.5 \\frac{V_{h} N_{A}}{M}, \\] where \\(V_{h}\\) is the volume of the hydrated sphere, \\(N_{A}\\) is Avogadro's number, and \\(M\\) is the sphere's mass.We can see here that globular molecules of any size will have the same approximate intrinsic viscosity.

Translational Diffusion Coefficient: thermal motion of molecules in solution causing them to move when when not subjected to an external force. Rotational Diffusion: Intrinsic Viscosity: Sedimentation Sedimentation is a widely used hydrodynamic technique using ultracentrifugation. There are two types of sedimentation experiments (described [here]/types): 1) where the velocity is measured, and 2) where, at equilibrium, the concentration distribution is measured.

The particle will displace the mass of the solvent, creating its effective bouyant mass as: \\[ m_{b} = \\frac{M}{N_{A}} (1- \\bar\\nu\\rho). $$ The centrifugal force that is experienced by the particle is then: $$ F_{c} = \\frac{M}{N_{A}} (1- \\bar\\nu\\rho)\\omega^{2}r. \\] This force now produces a velocity, which is resisted by a frictional force: \\[ F_{f_{r}} = -f_{t}v = -f_{t}\\frac{dr}{dt}. \\] In a steady state situation (sum of forces is zero), we can define the sedimentation coefficient as the velocity of the particle per unit acceleration: \\[ S = \\frac{dr}{dt}\\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}r} = \\frac{M(1-\\bar\\nu\\rho)}{N_{A}f_{t}}. \\] This coefficent, \\(S\\) , has units of seconds (s), and are typically in the range of \\(10^{-13}\\) s to \\(10^{-10}\\) .

Vacuum System The vacuum system consists of a diffusion pump in series with a mechanical vacuum pump. The system starts automatically when a run is stated, or manually with \"Vacuum\" on the touch screen. When the vacuum system is on, the chamber pressure will be displayed in microns. To vent the vacuum after a run is finished, select the \"Vent Vacuum\" button on the display screen. After the door is opened, you will have a 5-minute window to switch out the rotors/cells wherein the chamber temperature remains as set. After this time period, the chamber will return to the approximate room temperature to minimize any condensation collection within the chamber. If there are any leaks in cells prior to rotor acceleration, the vacuum system will be unable to pull a complete vacuum and will stop, showing an alert on the display screen. There will also be a change in temperature. Leaks in the chamber itself are represented by discharge of oil vapor into the room. Check the Xenon flash-lamp assemble and ensure the the O-ring on the top of the flash lamp is intact and in place. Check the gasket on the underside of the sliding steel door to make sure it is intact, clean, and lightly covered in vacuum grease. If these checks do not resolve the issue, get a service engineer or experienced operator to check the photo-multiplier tube assembly. Temperature Sensing and Control The temperature within the rotor chamber is measured by a solid state thermophile located in the bottom of the chamber. The Optima uses a solid state thermo-electric refrigeration and heating system, and cooling is provided by forced air from fans. Temperature control occurs when the door is closed and the vacuum system is running.

This console can indicate the progression of experimental designs, and allows for remote monitoring capabilities. Door and Barrier The door is made of high-strength structural steel with a solenoid interlock to prevent contact with a spinning rotor. The door locks automatically when it is closed and a run has begun. It can only be opened when the rotor is at rest with the chamber at atmospheric pressure. A 41-mm (1.63-in.) steel alloy armor ring acts as the primary barrier, surrounded by a 13-mm (0.5-in.) vacuum chamber to provide full protection for the operator. Imbalance Detector And Over-speed Systems The imbalance detector will force an automatic shutdown if the rotor loads are severely out of balanced. Over-speed disks are located on the bottom of all rotors. Their alternating reflecting and non-reflecting sectors pass over the photo-electric device, generating a series of electrical pulses that can be analysed by the circuitry and software of the instrument. The set speed is checked against the over-speed disk after the rotor reaches 1,000 RPM. If the set speed is found to be greater than the allowed speed permitted by the disk, the speed setting is automatically lower without interrupting the run. An error message will however be displayed to alert the operator to the change.","title":"Optima&#8482; AUC"},{"location":"instru/#beckman-coulter-optima-auc","text":"10 micron radial resolution 0.5 nm wavelength resolution Network interface Multi-wavelength capable Built-in database for data acquisition The Optima\u2122 AUC was released by Beckman Coulter in 2016.

After the door is opened, you will have a 5-minute window to switch out the rotors/cells wherein the chamber temperature remains as set. After this time period, the chamber will return to the approximate room temperature to minimize any condensation collection within the chamber. If there are any leaks in cells prior to rotor acceleration, the vacuum system will be unable to pull a complete vacuum and will stop, showing an alert on the display screen. There will also be a change in temperature. Leaks in the chamber itself are represented by discharge of oil vapor into the room. Check the Xenon flash-lamp assemble and ensure the the O-ring on the top of the flash lamp is intact and in place. Check the gasket on the underside of the sliding steel door to make sure it is intact, clean, and lightly covered in vacuum grease. If these checks do not resolve the issue, get a service engineer or experienced operator to check the photo-multiplier tube assembly. Temperature Sensing and Control The temperature within the rotor chamber is measured by a solid state thermophile located in the bottom of the chamber. The Optima uses a solid state thermo-electric refrigeration and heating system, and cooling is provided by forced air from fans. Temperature control occurs when the door is closed and the vacuum system is running. A coarse pictorial side view of the general layout of the temperature control system from past and present analytical ultracentrifuges made by the same manufacturer. A) Model E analytical ultracentrifuge, bottom area shows the approximate location of the nichrome wire heating element (orange horizontal bars at the bottom of rotor) and the refrigerated cooling coils located along the outside wall of the rotor chamber, indicated by the blue vertical bars, B) the XL-A/XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge, bottom area shows the rough location of the Peltier cooling/heating cells (indicated by the orange/blue horizontal bars at the bottom of rotor located between the center of rotation and the radial position of the rotor holes), and C) the Optima analytical ultracentrifuge with the cooling/heating Peltier cells located along the outside wall of the rotor chamber (indicated by the orange/blue vertical bars). In all cases the solid red arrows indicate the directional flow of heat during heating while the dashed red arrows indicate the directional flow of heat during cooling.

Analytical Biochemistry. 631. 114306. 10.1016/j.ab.2021.114306. Console The Optima\u2122 AUC has a 15-inch (38 cm) touchscreen display console. This console can indicate the progression of experimental designs, and allows for remote monitoring capabilities. Door and Barrier The door is made of high-strength structural steel with a solenoid interlock to prevent contact with a spinning rotor. The door locks automatically when it is closed and a run has begun. It can only be opened when the rotor is at rest with the chamber at atmospheric pressure. A 41-mm (1.63-in.) steel alloy armor ring acts as the primary barrier, surrounded by a 13-mm (0.5-in.) vacuum chamber to provide full protection for the operator. Imbalance Detector And Over-speed Systems The imbalance detector will force an automatic shutdown if the rotor loads are severely out of balanced. Over-speed disks are located on the bottom of all rotors. Their alternating reflecting and non-reflecting sectors pass over the photo-electric device, generating a series of electrical pulses that can be analysed by the circuitry and software of the instrument. The set speed is checked against the over-speed disk after the rotor reaches 1,000 RPM. If the set speed is found to be greater than the allowed speed permitted by the disk, the speed setting is automatically lower without interrupting the run. An error message will however be displayed to alert the operator to the change.","title":"Instrument Components"},{"location":"interference/","text":"MS: \u2717 BD: \u2717 Interference Optics Has a lower sample concetration limit (~0.1 mg/ml) but can allow for the use of much more concentrated samples.

Studying these processes will give insight into the fundamental structure and function of life's building blocks, and allow us to study diseases that occur when these carefully calibratd equiliibria fail and where regulation and control no longer function. Biochemical and biophysical methods and instrumentation can help provide to our understanding, and can help up investigate these biological processes. Let us review the basics of what we currently understand about matter and energy. This process allows one to visualize how we have come to our current methadology for studying biophysics. Firstly, we know of the atomic nature of matter, in which atoms and molecules in motion will create heat, pressure, and diffusion. Furthermore, if we are able to measure these parameters, we can gain information of molecular number, size, mass, and shape. Second, atoms and molecules have a mass and a charge; they will move in response to an external gravitational/centrifugal/electric field. For example, see gel electro-phoresis or gravity purification techniques. Rates of their mmovement in such fields will provide information on molecular mass, charge, size, and shape. Now, onto electro-magnetic (EM) radiaation. EM Radiation is a light wave/particle (wave/particle duality), with a speed, amplituce, frequency, phase, polarization, absorbance and emission. In its wave form, EM radiation also experiences constructive and destructive interference. Let us now combine our knownledge of matter and EM radiation (energy). Their interactions can be through elastic and inelastic scattering, absorptiona dn emission, resonance (relationship to electronic or nuclear structure), refraction, diffraction, and reflection. So, if we use EM radiation or even thermal energy, we can interrogate biological matter to determine information on its structure, dynamics, and their interactions and distances from other biological matter. Since frequencies of abosrobed or emitted radiation are determined by the electronic and nuclear structure, adn the local enviromament around the atom/molecule, this can lead us to spectroscopic methods. The sponeneous loss of absorbed radiation will result in either heat or emitted light (fluoresnce or phosphoresnce), which can be used to probe distances by resonsnace transfer. As a result, instrument can be used to generate the thermal/EM radiaton or centrifugal/electric fields that can be used to interrogate biological material. Finally, equations and algorithms can quantitively describe how a change in a measureable parameter is related to otherwise undetectable atomic features. Hydrodynamics Hydrodyanmic parameters include quantities such as sedimentation and diffusion coefficients, rotational relaxation times, intrinsic viscoity, etc. These parameter allow us to determine how rapidly a molecule translates and rotates in solutions, and how they influence the solution. Additionally, when used in appropriate models, these parameters allow us to determine molecular weight, size, hydration, shape, flexability, conformation, and the degree of association of biological macromolecules.

Specifically, we will cover irreversible interactions that can lead to aggregation, and reversible interactions that are driven by mass action. TL;DR Irreversible interactions lead to aggregation which is typically pathologic or unphysiological. Reversible interactions are cause by weak interactions (electrostatic, hydrophobic) and lead to oligomerization . Molecules in solution can display dynamic behaviour in response to external perturbations and changes in their own concentration or environments. In particular, interactions between molecules can lead to covalent bond formation or non-covalent bond formation . Assemblies are formed when molecules interact with other molecules to form higher-order structures. When this interaction is between similiar molecules, it is refered to as self-association . When it is between molecules of different species, it is refered to as hetero-association . Self-Association: \\(A + A \\rightarrow A_{2}\\) . Eg., protein-protien, RNA-RNA, DNA-DNA. Hetero-Association: \\(A + B \\rightarrow AB\\) . Eg., protein-DNA, protein-RNA, DNA-RNA, protein-lipid, protein-carbohydrates, protein-small molecules/drugs/nanoparticles. Which interaction occures depends on the activation energy that needs to be overcome to interconvert between the forward and backward reaction. When the energy barrier becomes too high to go backwards, an interaction reaction is considered to be irreversible. Irreversible Interactions Examples of events that can cause irreversible solution interactions: Oxidation Covalent Cross-Lining (chemically or photo-activated) Hydrophobic, van der Waals interactions, coupled with entropic effects Strucutral changes in the molecules (amyloid beta - beta sheet, insulin fibrils) EXAMPLE Amyloid Beta Aggregation Speransky, V. et al. 2001 J. Cell Biol., 153, 1327 - 1335 Reversible Interactions Reversible interactions typically require structural complementarity and are cause by weak forves and molecular attractions (electrostatic, hydrophobic, salt bridgess, van der Waals forces, and hydrogen bonds). Electrostatic interactions are very important for nucleic acid binding. Dna has a strongly negatively charged backbone (PO_4^-), which can form salt bridges with positively charged amines from lysine sidechains, allowing the stiff, double-stranded DNA to curl around the nucleosome and become flexible. There can be multiple types of reversible reactions that are either self-associations or hetero-associations. The concentration in one component will affect the concentration of the other. Reactions can be fast (diffusion controlled) or slow (kinetically limited), and they observe mass action laws. EXAMPLE Human A. Schiefner et al., Biochem. J. 2015, 466(1) 95-104 There can be multiple reactions: \\(A + A \\leftrightarrow A_{2}\\) ; \\(A_{2} + B \\leftrightarrow A_{2}B\\) ; which can be fast (diffusion controlled) or slow (kinetically limited), and they observe mass action laws.

Assume the partial specific volume is constant at all salt concentrations at 0.72 ml/g. Explain a possible modelfor this observation. What can you conclude about the function of salt with respect to any oligomerization? What can you conclude about the oligomerization state?

See image below. Xenon flash lamps are good at emitting visible light down to 190 nm, but above 500 nm, the intensity drops off rather precipiticely. Around 800 nm, the intensity will be a small fraction of what can be seen around 230 nm. If you must measure at higher O.D. values, and you want a lot of singal, measuring at 230 nm may be a good idea. Figure: Emission profile for a Xenon flash lamp. To measure the XENON LAMP EMISSION PROFILE, run an intensity wavelength scan over the dynamic range of the instrument on an empty hole at 6.5 cm. Rotor speed is irrelavent; it is commonly set to 3,000 rpm. You should see a profile similar to the one above, with a peak intensity at 230 nm of at least 15,000 counts. If the intensity is much less than this, clean the lamp, or call for Beckman Services to check the optical system, mirror, PMT, and/or powersupply. If you want to attempt to clean the lamp yourself, and the count is still lower than 15,000 counts, the lamp may need to be aligned. For the XL-A: rotate the lamp in the lamp housing and repeat the intensity scan. Repeat for one full turn, identifying the position that produces the highest intensity. Verify that this is reproducible across every position in the cell. Monochromator Function To measure MONOCHROMATOR FUNCTION, run an intensity wavelength scan over the dynamic range on an empty hole at 5.2 cm, 6.5 cm, and 7.1 cm. If the intensity peaks shift, the monochromator may not be working properly. Slit Assembly Performance For SLIT ASSEMBLY PERFORMANCE testing, you will need to scan a cell with some solution (irrelavant) with 280 nm or 230 nm. Check the overlaid menisci of 40-50 scans. They should form a single sharp peak. If the meniscus shifts back and forth, the slit assembly may need to be serviced. The slit assembly is a gold foil with laser-etched slits that provides the radial resolution measured by the PMT. This mechanical assembly in the Proteomlab is driven by a servo motor; the Optima AUC uses a digital stepping motor. The stepping motor is much more radially precise at 10 micron resolution. If there is dirt on the slit assembly, it may cause some stepping.","title":"Optical System Performance"},{"location":"maint/#confirming-optical-system-performance","text":"Xenon Flash Lamp Emission Profile Absorbance optics uses a Xenon flash lamp and the intensity of the lamp varies over the spectral range.

Many processes can be described using differential equations. When solved, these equations can describe a linear or non-linear model. TL;DR: How to Build Models Modeling involves the description of some observable data using a mathematical equation that describes the underlying physical properties of the experiment. Our process is as such: We need to identify a general, mathematical model that can represent the observed data. The parameters of the model describe the specifics of the data. We need to determine the values of the parameters in the model that best fit our data. This is accomplished by a fitting algorithm that minimizes the differences between the data and the model. Generally, an initial estimate is required that is then improved. We need to estimate the error in the parameters we determined in the fitting process to obtain the confidence intervals EXAMPLE: Radioactive Decay Model Building Hypothesis: The rate of decay is proportional to the number of nuclei present Mathematical Model: \\[ \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial t} = -a N \\] Solve: \\[ N = N_{0} e^{-a(t+t_{s})}+ b \\] MODELS FOR REACTING SYSTEMS: The magnitude of the measureable off-rate depends on the rotor speed and sedimentation coefficient. For faster rotor speeds, higher molecular weight and globular shape will favour the measurement of faster rate constants. Data Fitting Any observable process that influences the measurement needs to be acccounted for in order for models to yeld any meaningful result. The object is then to minimize the residuals between the model and the data. Iverse preoblem: extracting parameters from a simulated solution by fitting the model to experimental data. A non-parametric fit is used to smooth data for display, where the instrinsic model is of little intrest, and hence the parameters are not needed. Method of Least-Squares When useing the Method of Least Squares, we make the following assumptions: The model is a truthful representation of reality. All error is ssociated with a dependent variable. All experimental noise is considered to be of Gaussian distribution. The minimum in the differences occur when the derivative of our objective function with respect to the parameters is zero, so we need to differentiate it with respect to the parameters of interest, a and b. This will lead to a system of linear equations. Any observable process that influences the measurement needs to be accounted for in order for the model to yield meaningful results. Our objective is then to minimize the residuals between the model and the data: \\[ MIN \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{Data_{i} - Model _{i}}{uncertainty_{i}}\\right)^{2} = MIN \\chi^{2}. \\] Extracting parameters from the simulated solution by fitting the model to experimetal data is called an \\(\\bf{\\text{Inverse Problem}}\\) . LEAST-SQUARES EQUATION FOR STRAIGHT LINES: The equation for a straight line is a linear equation: y = mx +b. Remember our least squares equation above; for a straight line, it changes to: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{D_{i} -(a+bx_{i})}{\\sigma_{i}}\\right)^{2} = \\chi^{2}(a,b). \\] The distances from the experimental data and the linear fit are measured to be perpendicular to the data (see figure), and the objective of this method is to find the equation of a straight line that minimizes the distance between the data and the fit. SOLVING THE LEAST SQUARES EQUATION (LINEAR LINE): The minimum in the differences between our data and our fit occurs when the derivative of our function (with respect to the parameters) is zero. Therefore, we must take our least squares equation and differentiate it: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{D_{i} -(\\bf{a} +\\bf{b}x_{i})}{\\sigma_{i}}\\right)^{2} = \\chi^{2}(\\bf{a,b}). \\] With respect to parameter \\(a\\) : \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\chi^{2}(\\bf{a,b}) }{\\partial \\bf{a}} = 0 = -2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( \\frac{D_{i} - \\bf{a} - b x_{i}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}\\right). \\] With respect to parameter \\(b\\) : \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\chi^{2}(\\bf{a,b})}{\\partial \\bf{b}} = 0 = -2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( \\frac{x_{i}(D_{i} - a - \\bf{b} x_{i})}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}\\right). \\] This will lead to a system of linear equations: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\bf{a}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}} + \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{\\bf{b}x_{i}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{D_{i}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}; \\] \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\bf{a}x_{i}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}} + \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{\\bf{b}x_{i}^{2}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{D_{i}x_{i}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}. \\] When in matrix form, this system of equations can be solved by using Cramer's rule, such that: \\[ x_{1} = \\frac{b_{1}a_{22}-b_{2}a_{12}}{a_{11}a_{22}-a_{12}a_{21}}, ~~ x_{2} = \\frac{b_{2}a_{11}-b_{1}a_{21}}{a_{11}a_{22}-a_{12}a_{21}}. \\] Linear Models As discussed above, we know that the equation for a linear equation is \\(y = a + bx\\) , and we know that the equation is linear in the coefficients that are fitted. In fact, the equation doesnt have to be that of a straight line to be considered linear. Rather, we can express it with a polynomial: \\[ y = c_{0} + c_{1}x^{1} + c_{2}x^{2} + ... + c_{n}x^{n}. \\] Then, as long as the coefficients are linear, the equation will be considered a linear fitting equation. It does not matter how wildly non-linear the terms of the independent variable are. For example, our variables can be exponentials, or trignometric functions (all of which are not linear): \\[ y = c_{0} + (x-\\sin(x^{3})c_{1} + \\exp^{-(4-3x)}c_{2} + \\ln(3x^{4})c_{3} + ... + c_{n}X_{n}, \\] with \\(X_{n}\\) being any non-linear term. That being said, sometimes we may want to constrain the value of a paramater. For example, suppose we do not want the amplitude of an exponential term to turn negative during the fitting process. We can prevent this by fitting the log of a number, such that the fitted value will never be negative. \\[ y = \\bf{a} e^{bx} + c \\rightarrow e^{\\ln(\\bf{a}) + bx} + c; ~~ e^{ln(a)} = a. \\] EXAMPLE: Linearization Linearization of a Non-Linear Equation Suppose we have an exponential equation of the form: \\[ y = c_{1}e^{c_{2}x}. \\] To linearize it, we take the natural logarithm on both side. \\[ \\ln(y) = \\ln(c_{1}\\cdot e^{c_{2}x}) = \\ln(c_{1}) + c_{2}x. \\] Non-Linear Regression What is the importance of an equation being linear or non-linear? It turns out that non-linear functions require fitting using iterative approaches, while linear functions can be fitted using a single interation. Consider the Jacobian matrix for non-linear systems: \\[ \\bf{J} = \\frac{d \\bf{f}}{d \\bf{x}} = \\frac{\\partial \\bf{f}}{\\partial x_{1}} \\cdots \\frac{\\partial \\bf{f}}{\\partial x_{n}}= \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_1} & \\cdots & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_n} \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_m}{\\partial x_1} & \\cdots & \\frac{\\partial f_m}{\\partial x_n} \\end{bmatrix} \\] We are hoping to iteratively improve the parameter estimates by following along the gradient of the error functino in the direction of maximum imporovement. This requires knowledge of the partial derivatives of each parameters at each point in the experiment. Let us therefore take: \\[ \\bf{J} (a-g) = \\Delta y, \\] where \\(\\bf{J}\\) is the Jacobian matrix, shown above, \\(g\\) is the current parameter estimate, \\(a\\) is the adjustment made to the parameter estimate in the current iternation, and \\(\\Delta y\\) is the difference between the experimental data and the model. To solve for the value of \\(a\\) : \\bf{J}^{T}J (a-g) = \\bf{J}^{T}\\Delta y. Once here, we have two options. Option 1: \\[ (\\bf{J}^{T}\\bf{J}^{-1})\\bf{J}^{T}(a-g) = (\\bf{J}^{T}\\bf{J})^{-1}\\bf{J}^{T} \\Delta y. \\] Option 2 is when \\(\\bf{J}^{T}\\bf{J}\\) is positive, so that we can use the Cholesky decomposition ( \\(\\bf{J}^{T}\\bf{J} = \\bf{LL}^{T}\\) ). We then iterate until the function converges. EXAMPLE: Appropriateness of Fitting Approaches For each of the following situations, what is the fitting approach. Is it non-parametric, gradient descent, grid method, or stochastic? Is it linear or non-linear in its fitting parameters? If the appraoch is non-parametric, propose a function for it. A. Smoothing a set of noisy data with a recognizable wave pattern B. Fitting parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from function: \\[ F(x) = a_{0} + a_{1}\\log(ax) + a_{2}\\sin(b-x^{2}) + c \\] C. Fitting paramaters \\(a_{i}\\) from function: \\[ F(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{100}a_{i}e^{b_{i}(x^{2}-c^{2})},~~\\text{where}~ b_{i} = \\frac{1}{100}. \\] D. Fitting paramaters \\(a_{j}\\) from function: \\[ F(x) = a_{0} + a_{1}\\log(bx) + a_{2}\\sin(a_{3}-x^{2}) + c \\] E. Fitting parameters \\(a, b\\) , and \\(c\\) from function: \\[ F(x) = \\log(ax) + \\sin(bx^{2}) + c \\] F: Fitting parameters \\(a_{1}\\) to \\(a_{8}\\) : \\[ F(x) = a_{1}\\log(a_{2x}) + \\frac{a_{3}\\sin(\\sqrt{2}a_{4}x^{2})}{a_{7}x^{3}} + a_{5}e^{a_{6}x^{2}/2} + a_{8} \\] Experimental Uncertainties, Error Surfaces, and Fit Quality EXPERIMENTAL UNCERTAINTIES: The uncertainty of an measurement can be determined by repeating the expriment several times. Each time, a slightly different value is obtained for the experimental observation. If we assume a Gaussian distribution of errors in the measurement, we can determine the standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\) , of the distribution of measured parametes. Then we can use \\(\\sigma\\) to set the error bars on the measurement and to scale the contribution of a datapoint to the sum of residuals. To calculate the standard deviataion, use the following equation: \\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \\bar x)^{2}}, \\] where \\(\\bar x\\) is the average of all measurements. ERROR SURFACES: Each parameter combination a, b results in a unique error when fitted to the experimental data. The optimal solution occurs where the error is the smallest. Ideally, the error surface is continuously differentiable. GOODNESS OF FIT: The quality of the fit is determined by the randomness of the residuals, and the root mean square deviatio (RMSD). The randomness of the residuals can be measured by determining the runs. Runs (R) are the number of consecutive positive (p) or negative (n) residuals from the mean. \\[ R_{T} = \\frac{R-\\bar R}{\\sigma_{R}} \\] where \\(R_{T}\\) is the measure of randomness, and: \\[ \\bar R = \\frac{2np}{n + p} + 1 \\] \\[ \\sigma_{R}^{2} = \\frac{2np(2np-n-p)}{n+p)^{2}(n+p-1)}. \\] Optimization Methods For linear fits, our options for optimizing methods include straight line fits, generalized inear least squares, non-negative constrained least squares, multi-dimensional spectrum analyses, and non-parametric fits. Examples of non-parametric fits are B-splines and polynomial smoothing. For non-linear optimizatin using gradient descent methods for functions of type, \\(y = F(a_{i},x_{i})\\) , we can use Levenberg-Marquardt, Gauss-Newton, Quasi-Netwon, conjugate gradients, tangent approximation, or neural networks. A problem with non-linear least squares optimization is that for multi-component systems, the algorithm gets easily stuck in local minima and the solution will depend on the starting points. This problem gets worse when there are more parameters.

Recipe for Monte Carlo Obtain a best-fit solution from model function fit and confirm that the residuals are random and without systematic deviation Generate new synthetic Guassian noise with the same quality as was observed in the original experiment and add it to the best-fit solution Bootstrapping: permute a percentage of residuals. Take any residual, positive or nagative, and place it elsewhere in the data. The assumption here is that the likelihood of a residual's magnitude is the same anywhere in the dataset. Generating Gaussian Noise: run a 5-7 point Gaussian kernel over the residual vector from the best fit and use the Box-Buller algorithm to generate random new noise with the same quality at that position based on the varience obtained from the 5-point kernel. Essentially: take the absolute value of the residual values from 5-7 poiints, and smooth them with a gaussian kernel. The average residual value is fed into the Box-Muller function to generate a new random residual that has a Guassian probabiliyt distribution with a mean of the average residual value. Generaton of Guassian Noise is preferred beacuse the quality of the noisevaries at different points in the cell and also varies with absorbance.

Take any residual, positive or nagative, and place it elsewhere in the data. The assumption here is that the likelihood of a residual's magnitude is the same anywhere in the dataset. Generating Gaussian Noise: run a 5-7 point Gaussian kernel over the residual vector from the best fit and use the Box-Buller algorithm to generate random new noise with the same quality at that position based on the varience obtained from the 5-point kernel. Essentially: take the absolute value of the residual values from 5-7 poiints, and smooth them with a gaussian kernel. The average residual value is fed into the Box-Muller function to generate a new random residual that has a Guassian probabiliyt distribution with a mean of the average residual value. Generaton of Guassian Noise is preferred beacuse the quality of the noisevaries at different points in the cell and also varies with absorbance.

Recall the section on speed in the page on the experimental technique of sedimentation veloctity. When observing the properties of a single molecule, judicious selection of one rotor speed optimizes the avaliale information, but accurary and precision is sacrified when one is limited to only selecting one speed for heterogenous mixtures. Heterogeneous mixtures present complications making it that no single speed will be optimal for all species. Single speeds can also prevent the investigator from asking specific questions together. For example: If molar mass or anisotropy needs to be determine, you will need to have a slow speed to generate sufficient diffusion information. However this sacrifices composition details. If composition detail is required, you need a higher speed, but balancing the signals from diffusion and sedimentation using only one speed is challanging. There is no guide to consult and the composition is not known before hand to help with picking the optimal speed. Therefore, the ability to perform an experiment at multiple speeds provides additional detail and resolution for mixtures of particles that are heterogenous in sedimentation coefficients. The main idea behind multi-speed SV experiments is this: for mixtures containin solutes that exhibit range in sedimentation and diffusion coefficients, experiments with speed profiles incorporating multiple speeds will better match the properites of each solute. Experimental Design Now, we will describe: how to design a suitable speed profile for a heterogeneous mixture, and; how a suitable finite-element analysis method can exploit the sedimentation and diffusion signal avaliable from multiple speed steps. For heterogeneous systems, each component will have a different sedimentation coefficient, and so the duration will be diferent for each species. As described previously , the equation to determine the theoretical duration of an experiment is: \\[ t = \\ln \\left( \\frac{r_{b}}{r_{m}}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}s} \\] where \\(r_{m}\\) is the meniscus position and \\(r_{b}\\) is the bottom position of the cell (considered to be infinitely long). The optimal time, \\(t\\) , is no less than the duration required for the midpoint of the boundary from each component with sedimentation coefficient, \\(s\\) , to sediment from the meniscus position to the point where it would reach the bottom of the cell. Knowning this, the first speed step should start with the lowest speed which will have a low enough speed, \\(v_{1}\\) , and large enough duration, \\(t_{1}\\) , to provide sufficient diffusion signal and scanning time. This speed will optimally describe the largest species in the system. The second speed step, \\(v_{2}\\) , is for measuring the second largest species. For predicting \\(t_{2}\\) , consider the sedimentation displacement for species 2 during the first speed step and subtract that amount from the sedimenation still required from the boundary midpoint from species 2 to reach the bottom. Subsequent speed steps, \\(v_{n}\\) , follow the same principle with each species aquiring a new meniscus from each speed step. The change in speed for each step depends on the \\(s\\) value distribution. This value can be approximated from a single-speed experiment if it is not known. Here is a program (pdf , C++ file ) that takes the original meniscus, the largest \\(s\\) value, and the starting and maximal rotor speed to predit the apropriate rotor speeds and speed step durations for optimal speed step configurations. Overall, variable speed profiles allow the investigator to obtain much higher precision and accurary for heterogeneous samples. This is exceptionally demonstrated in the example below. Example: Experimental Design for 5-Component Simulation Model To establish the value of multi-speed SV measurents, consider the following example where a mixture of five discrete components at identical concentrations are simulated. The components span five orders of magniture in molar mass, have a five-fold change in anisotropy, and have identical partial specific volumes. \\(\\textbf{Table 1}\\) : Simulation parameters for a five-component simulation model. \\[ \\begin{array}{llllll} \\hline \\text{Parameter/Solute} & \\text{Solute 1} & \\text{Solute 2} & \\text{Solute 3} & \\text{Solute 4} & \\text{Solute 5} \\\\ \\hline s ~(\\times 10^{13}~\\text{s}) & 1.0111 & 2.3464 & 7.2608 & 25.276 & 93.858 \\\\ D ~(\\times 10^{7}~\\text{cm}^{2}/\\text{s}) & 18.862 & 4.3774 & 1.3545 & 0.47154 & 0.17509 \\\\ \\text{Molar Mass (Da)} & 5.0 \\times 10^{3} & 5.0\\times 10^{4} & 5.0\\times 10^{5} & 5.0\\times 10^{6} & 5.0\\times 10^{7}\\\\ f/f_{0} & 1.0 & 2.0 & 3.0 & 4.0 & 5.0 \\\\ \\text{Absorbance} & 0.2 & 0.2 & 0.2 & 0.2 & 0.2\\\\ \\bar\\nu~(\\text{ml/g}) & 0.74 & 0.74 & 0.74 & 0.74 & 0.74 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] Speeds were chosen to span the range of the AUC such that there is approximately a factor of 250-fold change in the centrifugal forces.

Importantly, the single best reproduced species is different for each speed step and when all speed steps are considered, each species can be defined with a very low error. When compared to a simulated standard single speed SV experiment, there is a 54% improvement when performing the multi-speed simulation (analyzed with 2DSA-MC).

These challenges are rotor stretch, shifting radial positions at different speeds, and the lack of acceleration profiles and time-state information. Solutions for these issues have been resolved and implemented in UltraScan. UltraScan separates each speed step into seperate experimental datasets when collecting multi-speed data. Initially, each speed step must be analyzed as a separate experiment. The first step in the analysis procedure is to identify the maximum \\(s\\) value. The slowest speed step contains the signal from the fastest sedimenting solutes and should therefore be used to determine the upper limit of all speed steps. To eliminate time-invariant noise by scan pair subtraction, it is best to use the time-derivative method 1 that is implemented in UltraScan. To estimate the upper limit, select a group of scans near the end of the first speed step. The point where the \\(g^{*}(s)\\) distribution approaches zero on the high end of the sedimentation coefficient spectrum should represent the upper limit. For the lowest \\(s\\) value, it is usually appropriate to set it to 0.5 s, unless otherwise known to be higher. Frictional ratio ranges can also be chosen based on prior knowlege of the system's species. The data analysis on UltraScan is performed on parallel architectures. 2 The steps are the same as those outlined in the Sedimentation Velocity Analysis Flowchart . Remember that each speed step should be treated initially as a separate analysis, allowing for the use of a different 2DSA grid for each speed step. Furthermore, each speed step requires simulation of all the prior speed steps becuase the acceleration history needs to be preserved to obtain the appropriate initial concentration distribution for each modelled solute at the beginning of each speed step.

Normally distributed noise from non-linearity in the optics, intensity fluctuations of the lamp flashes, refractive artifacts, and systematic contributions of unknown sources. Emre H.

(2020). A calibration disk for the correction of radial errors from chromatic aberration and rotor stretch in the Optima AUC TM analytical ultracentrifuge. European Biophysics Journal , 49 (8). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00249-020-01434-z Calibration Results Using the calibration disk, described here , highly accurate and reproducible rotor stretching profiles for Beckman's AN50Ti and AN60Ti rotors were obtained (see Table 1). The rotor stretch fits for the same rotor at 20 \\(~^{o}\\) C varied by less than 0.25% in the stretch numbers at 60,000 RPM. When comparing the same rotor (Table 1: Rotor 92u341) across three different temperatures ( \\(4~^{o}\\) C, \\(20~^{o}\\) C, and \\(37~^{o}\\) C), there was a maximum of 0.88% difference. This finding is consistent with previous research on the physical properties of titanium 1 2 which suggest minimal changes as a function of temperature. However, the mximum stretch values at 60,000 RPM from three An60Ti rotors varied by as much as 3% when measured at the same temperature. Predicted values for the An50Ti rotor suggest that these rotors will stretch more than the An60Ti rotors by an average of 4.3%. The amount of maximum stretch was not correlated to the age of the rotor. \\(\\textbf{Table 1}\\) Rotor stretch calibration resutls for the five rotors in use at the Canadian Center for Hydrodynamics at the University of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. \\[\\begin{array}{llcll} \\hline \\text{Rotor} & \\text{Type} & \\text{Temperature (}^{o}\\text{C)} & \\text{50 kRPM Stretch (cm)} & \\text{60 kRPM Stretch (cm)} \\\\ \\hline 17u900 & \\text{AN}50 & 20 & 0.002228 & 0.03163 \\\\ 97u378 & \\text{AN}50 & 20 & 0.02252 & 0.03176 \\\\ 00u569 & \\text{AN}50 & 20 & 0.02124 & 0.02982 \\\\ \\hline 18u919 & \\text{AN}60 & 20 & 0.02184 & 0.03038 \\\\ \\hline 92u341\\text{-a} & \\text{AN}60 & 20 & 0.02137 & 0.03022 \\\\ 92u341\\text{-b} & \\text{AN}60 & 20 & 0.02145 & 0.03030 \\\\ 92u341 & \\text{AN}60 & 4 & 0.02152 & 0.03043 \\\\ 92u341 & \\text{AN}60 & 37 & 0.02141 & 0.03049 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\\] Profile Collections Here is a method to measure the titanium rotor stretch of the 4-hole An-60 and the 8-hole An-50 rotors as a function of speed to predict the precise movement of the radial reference frame during rotor acceleration. The protocol (for both the Optima AUC and the Proteomelab instrument) is as follows. Using the manufacturere's counterbalance in hole 4 or hole 8 (dependent on rotor type), the Optima AUC was radially calibratied, using the manufactuer's programmed method. This method calibrates at 3,000 rpm and 250 nm. The calibration disk, described above, is sandwiched between two windows and their window holders in the standard cell housing, fitted with two spaces (8.5 mm space above the upper windown, 3 mm space below the lower window). The opposite hole can be filled with either a counterbalance or filled cell of equal weight to balance the rotor. The rotor is accelerated to 60,000 rpm for 10 mins to allow for all cell components to enter their equilibirum positions within the cell housing. The rotor is brought down to rest, and temperature equilibrated for at least 2 hours under vacuum to remove any stretch hysteresis. Calibration data is collected with a run profile that accelerates to 3,000 rpm, and after a 15-min delay, scans the calibration disk at least 5 times. The rotor is then accelerated by 1,000 rpm to 4,000 rpm, and a second round of data collection is performed, after another 15 minute delay. This is repeated, with increments of 1,000 rpm for each step, until the maximum speed is reached. For the An-60, that is 60,000 rpm; for the An-50, it is 50,000 rpm. \\(\\textbf{Figure 1}\\) Intensity rotor stretch data collected from a calibration disk from an An-60 rotor, 0-60,000 rpm in 1,000 rpm steps. Insert: Zoomed region shows the quadratic change in stretch spacing dependence on rotor speed. Colour changes from blue, green, yellow, to red, as the speed increases. Analysis of Profiles \\(\\textbf{Figure 2}\\) Rotor stretching data for an AN60Ti rotor between 10,000 RPM and 60,000 RPM (blue), fitted to a second order polynomial (red). The black crosses represent the standard deviation. The rotor calibration experiment is the first set of data all UltraScan-III users should acquire for their own rotor and instrument. Titanium rotors used in the Beckman Analytical Ultracentrifuge will stretch as a function of rotor speed, temperature, age and type of centerpieces loaded in them. UltraScan-III contains a rotor calibration program that allows you to easily determine your rotor's particular rotor stretching function, and to incorporate this information automatically in the analysis routines in UltraScan. The idea is that you run a calibration experiment where the stretching of the rotor is measured on your instrument, and then these data are fitted to a rotor stretching function, which is then stored in the program and used to provide, in combination with the known centerpiece geometry, the correct boundary conditions for the ASTFEM solutions. Step 1: Measurement of the calibration data To measure the calibration data, select the centerpieces and rotor to be calibrated and make sure that the centerpieces and counterbalance are properly balanced. An imbalance in the rotor may cause tilting, and deteriorate the sharpness of the centerpiece corners since they are no longer vertical. It is recommended to leave the centerpieces empty. Use fully assembled cells in the 4 hole rotor and 7 in the 8 hole rotor, and insert the counterbalance. Program a methods scan in the Beckman data acquisition software with the following settings: Radial mode, 0.001 cm resolution, continuous mode Limits: 5.7 cm to 7.3 cm Scan all cells, including the counterbalance Acquire intensity data, not absorbance or interference data. Set the monochromator to 230 nm Starting with 3000 rpm, perform duplicate or triplicate scans at 1000 rpm increments up to 50,000 (AN50Ti) or 60,000 rpm (AN60Ti) Wait for 5 minutes at each speed before scanning to make sure the rotor stretch is equilibrated Note for Proteomelab users: Use the Equilibrium Method Panel in the Beckman data acquisition program to program all speeds to make sure all speed scans are recorded in the same directory. Step 2: Convert Legacy Data Import the data into UltraScan-III with the \"Convert Legacy Data\" function in the \"Utilities\" menu. \\Make sure to classify the data as a \"Calibration\" experiment, not a velocity or equilibrium experiment! Create a new rotor with the rotor utility under \"Edit Run Information\", \"Select Lab/Rotor/Calibration\" with the \"Add new Rotor\" function. Select a default dummy rotor calibration, since you don't have a valid calibration yet. The dummy calibration is based on the calibration of one of our rotors, and is probably fairly typical for all Beckman rotors, but it is worth it to get your own calibration to make sure the data are optimal. Later on, you will be able to replace the dummy calibration with your own calibration so it can be picked by default. Proceed with the legacy data conversion as described in the UltraScan-III Manual. Step 3: Calculate the rotor calibration Load the data into the UltraScan-III Rotor calibration\" program in the \"Utilities\" menu. The program will show alternating views of the intensity profiles for top and bottom, and channel A and channel B. So, each cell will provide four sets of calibration data for the rotor stretch. These data also are used to calculate average dimensions for the cells and the center position at rest. This position should be at 6.500 cm. A consistent deviation of this number could reflect an incorrect radial calibration file for your instrument. The top of each channel is shown in red, and the bottom of each channel is shown in green. Using the mouse, draw a rectangle around the most vertical section of each plot as shown in this figure. Repeat until all cells and the counterbalance have been processed. When the last counterbalance corner has been defined, a calibration profile will appear on the screen and the calibration information can be viewed. In this example , the center position for cells 1-3 all show a consistent drift to the right, with about 0.02 cm offset from center. There are three possible reasons for this: the cell housings are worn out and the centerpiece is not correctly positioned in the center of the rotor hole; the rotor calibration file has inaccurate calibration information, or; the cell has not been properly aligned and the centerpiece is not correctly positioned in the rotor hole. When the bottom positions are significantly different for each channel of a cell, the cell may be misaligned in the rotor, When the bottom position at rest does not agree with the measured values for each centerpiece, then the calibration file is most likely inaccurate, or the cell housing is worn out.

The protocol (for both the Optima AUC and the Proteomelab instrument) is as follows. Using the manufacturere's counterbalance in hole 4 or hole 8 (dependent on rotor type), the Optima AUC was radially calibratied, using the manufactuer's programmed method. This method calibrates at 3,000 rpm and 250 nm. The calibration disk, described above, is sandwiched between two windows and their window holders in the standard cell housing, fitted with two spaces (8.5 mm space above the upper windown, 3 mm space below the lower window). The opposite hole can be filled with either a counterbalance or filled cell of equal weight to balance the rotor. The rotor is accelerated to 60,000 rpm for 10 mins to allow for all cell components to enter their equilibirum positions within the cell housing. The rotor is brought down to rest, and temperature equilibrated for at least 2 hours under vacuum to remove any stretch hysteresis. Calibration data is collected with a run profile that accelerates to 3,000 rpm, and after a 15-min delay, scans the calibration disk at least 5 times. The rotor is then accelerated by 1,000 rpm to 4,000 rpm, and a second round of data collection is performed, after another 15 minute delay. This is repeated, with increments of 1,000 rpm for each step, until the maximum speed is reached. For the An-60, that is 60,000 rpm; for the An-50, it is 50,000 rpm. \\(\\textbf{Figure 1}\\) Intensity rotor stretch data collected from a calibration disk from an An-60 rotor, 0-60,000 rpm in 1,000 rpm steps.

The black crosses represent the standard deviation. The rotor calibration experiment is the first set of data all UltraScan-III users should acquire for their own rotor and instrument. Titanium rotors used in the Beckman Analytical Ultracentrifuge will stretch as a function of rotor speed, temperature, age and type of centerpieces loaded in them. UltraScan-III contains a rotor calibration program that allows you to easily determine your rotor's particular rotor stretching function, and to incorporate this information automatically in the analysis routines in UltraScan. The idea is that you run a calibration experiment where the stretching of the rotor is measured on your instrument, and then these data are fitted to a rotor stretching function, which is then stored in the program and used to provide, in combination with the known centerpiece geometry, the correct boundary conditions for the ASTFEM solutions. Step 1: Measurement of the calibration data To measure the calibration data, select the centerpieces and rotor to be calibrated and make sure that the centerpieces and counterbalance are properly balanced. An imbalance in the rotor may cause tilting, and deteriorate the sharpness of the centerpiece corners since they are no longer vertical. It is recommended to leave the centerpieces empty. Use fully assembled cells in the 4 hole rotor and 7 in the 8 hole rotor, and insert the counterbalance. Program a methods scan in the Beckman data acquisition software with the following settings: Radial mode, 0.001 cm resolution, continuous mode Limits: 5.7 cm to 7.3 cm Scan all cells, including the counterbalance Acquire intensity data, not absorbance or interference data. Set the monochromator to 230 nm Starting with 3000 rpm, perform duplicate or triplicate scans at 1000 rpm increments up to 50,000 (AN50Ti) or 60,000 rpm (AN60Ti) Wait for 5 minutes at each speed before scanning to make sure the rotor stretch is equilibrated Note for Proteomelab users: Use the Equilibrium Method Panel in the Beckman data acquisition program to program all speeds to make sure all speed scans are recorded in the same directory. Step 2: Convert Legacy Data Import the data into UltraScan-III with the \"Convert Legacy Data\" function in the \"Utilities\" menu. \\Make sure to classify the data as a \"Calibration\" experiment, not a velocity or equilibrium experiment! Create a new rotor with the rotor utility under \"Edit Run Information\", \"Select Lab/Rotor/Calibration\" with the \"Add new Rotor\" function. Select a default dummy rotor calibration, since you don't have a valid calibration yet. The dummy calibration is based on the calibration of one of our rotors, and is probably fairly typical for all Beckman rotors, but it is worth it to get your own calibration to make sure the data are optimal. Later on, you will be able to replace the dummy calibration with your own calibration so it can be picked by default. Proceed with the legacy data conversion as described in the UltraScan-III Manual. Step 3: Calculate the rotor calibration Load the data into the UltraScan-III Rotor calibration\" program in the \"Utilities\" menu. The program will show alternating views of the intensity profiles for top and bottom, and channel A and channel B. So, each cell will provide four sets of calibration data for the rotor stretch. These data also are used to calculate average dimensions for the cells and the center position at rest. This position should be at 6.500 cm. A consistent deviation of this number could reflect an incorrect radial calibration file for your instrument. The top of each channel is shown in red, and the bottom of each channel is shown in green. Using the mouse, draw a rectangle around the most vertical section of each plot as shown in this figure. Repeat until all cells and the counterbalance have been processed. When the last counterbalance corner has been defined, a calibration profile will appear on the screen and the calibration information can be viewed. In this example , the center position for cells 1-3 all show a consistent drift to the right, with about 0.02 cm offset from center. There are three possible reasons for this: the cell housings are worn out and the centerpiece is not correctly positioned in the center of the rotor hole; the rotor calibration file has inaccurate calibration information, or; the cell has not been properly aligned and the centerpiece is not correctly positioned in the rotor hole. When the bottom positions are significantly different for each channel of a cell, the cell may be misaligned in the rotor, When the bottom position at rest does not agree with the measured values for each centerpiece, then the calibration file is most likely inaccurate, or the cell housing is worn out.

Brown, Balbo, Schuck. 2009. This paper studies the inter-related problems, clarifying experimental limitations, and developing tools to improve reliable data interpretation of SV AUC. Instrument Operation and Data Collection Monitoring Analysis Sedimentation velocity (SV) experiments are performed at high speeds to overcome the effects of diffusion. In an SV experiment, the speed is set such that the back diffusion from the bottom of the cell is minimal compared to the rate of sedimentation, forming a moving boundary. The evolution of the shape of this boundary over time is representative of the composition, sedimentation, and diffusion properties of the sample. Molecular weight can also be analyzed in ideal cases. SV experiments are best for: determining composition assaying for contaminants and aggregates distinguishing reversible from non-interacting systems (comparing concentration series) Optimal Speed and Duration This section is based on the research presented in: Gorbet, G. E., Mohapatra, S., & Demeler, B. (2018). Multi-speed sedimentation velocity implementation in UltraScan-III. European Biophysics Journal , 47 (7), 825-835. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00249-018-1297-z Williams, T. L., Gorbet, G. E., & Demeler, B. (2018).

European Biophysics Journal , 47 (7), 815-823. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00249-018-1308-0 What is the optimal speed for a given solution? The rotor's speed is a function of the mass of the particle, its diffusion characteristics, time between scans, and sample heterogeneity, but there is no simple relationship between them. It is important to consider the singal produced by the sedimenting particle for each of the fitted parameters (sedimentation coefficient, diffusion coefficient, etc.). The larger the signal of a parameter, the higher the confidence in the determination of the parameter. There is an inverse relationship between the sedimentation and diffusion transport signals as a function of the rotor speed and experiment duration. Consider the case where the rotor speed is increased: the seperation will increase; resolution is \\(s\\) is improved. But, a fast sedimenting particle will reduce the information avaliable for the diffusion coefficient because it does not spend much time diffusing before it is pelleted. Now, consider the case where the rotor speed is decreased: lower resolution in \\(s\\) ; more signal in \\(D\\) . Another factor to consider is the number of scans that can be collected during the duration of the experiment. There is a practical limit on the time avaliable for scanning based on the nmber of samples in the rotor. Futhermore, the transport by diffusion is proportional to the square root power of time, while transport due to sedimentation proceeds with the first power of time. Identification of Optimal Speed Profiles for Homogeneous and Heterogenous Samples Using Simulated Data For reliable test cases we can use simulated data, which permits a systematic evaluation of the information that is retrieved under conditions where rotor speed and experimental duration are varied, with all other paramaters held constant. It is crucial to have a properly designed experiment to recover information from a SV experiment. The following factors contribute to the informations quality: Column Length Longer columns allow for more data points with improved seperation. However, diffusion transport is maximized near the top of the cell, where the steep concentration gradients near the meniscus enhances diffusional flows. The diffusion has a similar effect at the bottom of the cell, where the concentration gradeients enhance diffusion information from the back-diffusional flow off the cell bottom. Despite the high concentration regions at the bottom tending to be outside most detector's dynamic range, the curvatureof the boundary is still significiantly affected in the regions where measurements are possible. Duration The experiment should be long enough to allow the solute to completely sediment. Lower information will be avaiable if the experiment is aborted too early, and collecting data past the pelleting or equilibiurm state is pointless as there will be no new information. Signal Concentration and Duration The amount of single avaliable should be scaled to the noise that is expected from the experiment. The Beckman Proteomelab XL-A has a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 250-300, and the Beckman Optima AUC is at least two-fold higher. The SNR is calculated by dividing the total signal by the RMSD of the fitted data when random residuals are obtained. Simulation Parameters for Experimental Datasets Maximum column length: 1.3 cm Mensiscus: 5.9 cm (1 mm air bubble above) Bottom of Cell: 7.2 cm Total Loading Volume: 0.45 ml The duration of the experiment for a given speed and solute is derived from: \\[ s = \\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}r}\\frac{\\text{d}r}{\\text{d}t}, \\] which is the definition of the sedimetation coefficient divided by the centrifugal field strength. This leads to the differential equation: \\[ \\int_{r_{m}}^{r_{b}} \\frac{\\text{d}r}{r} = \\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\\omega^{2}~\\text{d}t, \\] where \\(r_{m}\\) is the meniscus position, \\(t_{0}\\) is the starting time, and \\(r_{b}\\) is the midpoint of the boundary at some time \\(t\\) . When this equation is solved or \\(t\\) , with \\(t_{0}\\) = 0, we obtain an equation to predit the optimal duratio nof a SV experiment at any speed: \\[ t = \\ln \\left( \\frac{r_{b}}{r_{m}}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}s}. \\] This equation is embedded in a calculator in UltraScan that will estimate the optimal time for a given rotor speed and \\(s\\) value, and the optimal speed for a given experimental duration, given \\(s\\) . This equation is independent of the diffusion coefficient and guarentees optimal coverage of the avaible column length.

European Biophysics Journal , 47 (7), 825-835. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00249-018-1297-z Williams, T. L., Gorbet, G. E., & Demeler, B. (2018).

European Biophysics Journal , 47 (7), 815-823. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00249-018-1308-0 What is the optimal speed for a given solution? The rotor's speed is a function of the mass of the particle, its diffusion characteristics, time between scans, and sample heterogeneity, but there is no simple relationship between them. It is important to consider the singal produced by the sedimenting particle for each of the fitted parameters (sedimentation coefficient, diffusion coefficient, etc.). The larger the signal of a parameter, the higher the confidence in the determination of the parameter. There is an inverse relationship between the sedimentation and diffusion transport signals as a function of the rotor speed and experiment duration. Consider the case where the rotor speed is increased: the seperation will increase; resolution is \\(s\\) is improved. But, a fast sedimenting particle will reduce the information avaliable for the diffusion coefficient because it does not spend much time diffusing before it is pelleted. Now, consider the case where the rotor speed is decreased: lower resolution in \\(s\\) ; more signal in \\(D\\) . Another factor to consider is the number of scans that can be collected during the duration of the experiment. There is a practical limit on the time avaliable for scanning based on the nmber of samples in the rotor. Futhermore, the transport by diffusion is proportional to the square root power of time, while transport due to sedimentation proceeds with the first power of time. Identification of Optimal Speed Profiles for Homogeneous and Heterogenous Samples Using Simulated Data For reliable test cases we can use simulated data, which permits a systematic evaluation of the information that is retrieved under conditions where rotor speed and experimental duration are varied, with all other paramaters held constant. It is crucial to have a properly designed experiment to recover information from a SV experiment. The following factors contribute to the informations quality: Column Length Longer columns allow for more data points with improved seperation. However, diffusion transport is maximized near the top of the cell, where the steep concentration gradients near the meniscus enhances diffusional flows. The diffusion has a similar effect at the bottom of the cell, where the concentration gradeients enhance diffusion information from the back-diffusional flow off the cell bottom. Despite the high concentration regions at the bottom tending to be outside most detector's dynamic range, the curvatureof the boundary is still significiantly affected in the regions where measurements are possible. Duration The experiment should be long enough to allow the solute to completely sediment. Lower information will be avaiable if the experiment is aborted too early, and collecting data past the pelleting or equilibiurm state is pointless as there will be no new information. Signal Concentration and Duration The amount of single avaliable should be scaled to the noise that is expected from the experiment. The Beckman Proteomelab XL-A has a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 250-300, and the Beckman Optima AUC is at least two-fold higher. The SNR is calculated by dividing the total signal by the RMSD of the fitted data when random residuals are obtained.","title":"Optimal Speed and Duration"},{"location":"sed-veloc/#simulation-parameters-for-experimental-datasets","text":"Maximum column length: 1.3 cm Mensiscus: 5.9 cm (1 mm air bubble above) Bottom of Cell: 7.2 cm Total Loading Volume: 0.45 ml The duration of the experiment for a given speed and solute is derived from: \\[ s = \\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}r}\\frac{\\text{d}r}{\\text{d}t}, \\] which is the definition of the sedimetation coefficient divided by the centrifugal field strength. This leads to the differential equation: \\[ \\int_{r_{m}}^{r_{b}} \\frac{\\text{d}r}{r} = \\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\\omega^{2}~\\text{d}t, \\] where \\(r_{m}\\) is the meniscus position, \\(t_{0}\\) is the starting time, and \\(r_{b}\\) is the midpoint of the boundary at some time \\(t\\) . When this equation is solved or \\(t\\) , with \\(t_{0}\\) = 0, we obtain an equation to predit the optimal duratio nof a SV experiment at any speed: \\[ t = \\ln \\left( \\frac{r_{b}}{r_{m}}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}s}. \\] This equation is embedded in a calculator in UltraScan that will estimate the optimal time for a given rotor speed and \\(s\\) value, and the optimal speed for a given experimental duration, given \\(s\\) . This equation is independent of the diffusion coefficient and guarentees optimal coverage of the avaible column length. Example: Determine Experiment Duration Using Simulations Consider a molecule with a sedimentation coefficient of 5 S and frictional ratio of 1.28. The meniscus position, \\(r_{m}\\) is at 5.9 cm. What experiment duration is optimal is the rotor is run at a speed of 30 kRPM, 45 kRPM, and 60 kRPM? How does the shape of the boundary change?

Of course, you can conduct multiple experiments at various speeds in order to thouroughly characterize the sedimentation data.

When performing equilibrium experiments, it is not possible to distinguish the time-invariant noise patterns from the signals due to the balancing of the sediment flux with the diffusion flux (Fick's Laws). Solution 1: run empty cells and collect the intensity data patterns of each radial point and wavelength. The volume of the data collected must be significant (due to the presence of statistical noise in each scan) so that a time-invariant pattern can be averaged over all scans. It is important to note that while the AUC Optima claims to emit light with a one nanometer resolution over a 190 nm to 700 nm range, different patterns can be observed in both the shape and intensity of scans. This is especially prevalent at lower wavelengths and it seems that the monochromatic optical system does not completely split the light, and as a result, the light emitted at a particular wavelength can be partially mixed with neighboring wavelengths. The intensity of each scan is calculated by averaging the intensity of all radial points: \\[ \\hat I = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum^{N}_{i=1} I (R_{i}). \\] The root mean square deviation (RMSD) is calculated to quantify the shape of each scan: \\[ \\text{RMSD} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum^{N}_{i=1}(I(R_{i}) - \\hat I)^{2}}. \\] The mean and RMSD overlap of scans are clearly visible between neighboring wavelengths. How do we determine which scan belongs to which wavelength? Calculate the histogram (probability distribution function) of the RMSD values for each wavelength using the core density equilibrium method. Scans with similar scans are consider to be in a cluster; histograms are used to cluster scans of all wavelengths. The main scans of corresponding scans are assumed to be the scans belonging to the cluster with the highest probability distribution. If the non-original clusters overlap with the main cluster of adjacent wavelengths, the corresponding scans are transferred to the adjacent wavelength. The procedure for this method is imbedded in UltraScan, and the steps are outlined here.","title":"TI Noise in TI Signals"},{"location":"transport/","text":"MS: \u2717 BS: \u2717 Macromolecular Transport Processes TL;DR Transport processes are irreversible processes: the system is in a non-equilibirum state and relaxes toward an equilibirum, where transport will occur due to a potential applied to the system.

The software features an integrated data editing and analysis environment with a portable graphical user interface. UltraScan provides the highest possible resolution for sedimentation velocity experiments using high-performance computing modules for 2-dimensional spectrum analysis, genetic algorithm, and for Monte Carlo analysis. A MySQL database backend is integrated for data management, and the UltraScan LIMS system provides web-based access to the database and supercomputing functionality. Supercomputing resources are provided through a NSF Teragrid Science Gateway. Special care has been taken in the design of the software to guarantee an optimum in flexibility, user-friendliness, stability and convenience. The software is written in C++. The software features popular sedimentation velocity and equilibrium analysis methods as well as simulation modules, utilities, and editing modules with support for velocity and equilibrium experiments, single and multi-channel centerpieces, absorbance and interference optics. All analysis methods generate ASCII formatted data suitable for import into third-party plotting programs, and contains a built-in postscript printer engine to generate publication - quality graphical representations of analysis data. UltraScan is offered in two versions, UltraScan-II and UltraScan-III. The latter is a complete rewrite of the former, with many new features and a greatly improved interface. UltraScan-III was released in the summer of 2011 and will eventually replace the older version. We will maintain UltraScan-II to assure access to legacy data because UltraScan-III is not backward compatible with UltraScan-II. New users are encouraged to switch to UltraScan-III. In addition to numerous interface changes, the most important changes in UltraScan-III are listed below: UltraScan-III adheres to the OpenAUC standard. Can be used simultaneously in a local disk-only mode without the requirement for network connectivity, or fully integrated with network capability, including a database and supercomputing backend Contains a local 2DSA that is multi-threaded to take advantage of multi-core technology All hydrodynamic models are represented in a single, generalized and standard structure that can be interpreted by the ASTFEM simulator and understood throughout the program. All experimental data are stored in a new binary format that achieves 60-80% compression from the legacy Beckman data format All network communications are SSL encrypted and provide data privacy and security. Data ownership in the database is on a per-user level now A master password mechanism facilitates switching between multiple resources. A new rotor stretch calibration routine assures maximum accuracy for individually calibrated rotors A new reporting system provides much improved control over result report formatting Plots can be exported not only as bitmap, postscript, or PDF but also as SVG files which can be edited later on Finite element analysis for all methods, as well as data management is greatly improved to reduce the workflow without compromising flexibility The LIMS component of UltraScan, coupled with the high-performance computing backend dramatically improves analysis speed and throughput and allows simultaneous analysis of a virtually unlimited number of experiments.

The individual pages on each module are linked and provide a detailed explaination through how to use them. The most commonly used modules will be in red text. Edit Edit Data All experimental data aquired with the AUC requires pre-processing. This module creates an edit profile of the data. A user can create multiple edit profiles, and each profile receives a unique name. UltraScan assists in the process by handling the most essential diagnosics and editing steps automatically, but the user can intervene when necessary. Preferences This module contains a number of parameters that can be set to customize UltraScan according to personal preferences. This include directory paths, font and colour preferences, database preferences, and master password. Velocity Enhanced van Holde-Weischet This module differentiates boundary spreading due to diffusion from the boundary spreading due to the heterogeneity in sedimentation coefficients. Use this analysis technqiue using the fit generated by the final 2DSA refinement model. Then use Combine Distributions Plots (vHW) to view the boundary fraction as a function of sedimentation coefficient. Custom 2-D Grid Control This module enables you to edit custom 2-D initialization grids for the 2DSA. 2-D Spectrum Analysis This module enables you to perfrom a 2DSA on a chosen experimental data set. Upon completion of an analysis fit, the following avaliable plots include: experiment; simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals; time-invarient noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-D model. Paramertically Constrained Spectrum Analysis This module enables you to perfrom a PSCA on a chosen experimental data set. Upon completion of an analysis fit, the following avaliable plots include: experiment; simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals; time-invarient noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-D model. Initialize Genetic Algorithm This genetic algorithm program will generate solute distribution data. The output data is required in order to perform a genetic algorithm analysis on the UltraScan LIMS database. Initialize Discrete Model Genetic Algorithm Second Moment This module is used to calculate the weight-average sedimentation coefficeints for each scan included in an analysis by finding the second moment point of the boundary. Time Derivative This module allows you to determine the initial range of the sedimentation coefficient. FE Model Viewer This module is used to import, display, and export finite element solutions fitted to velocity experiments by various methods. It will import models from finite element fitting sessions, 2DSA fitts, genetic algorithm fits, or C(s) fits. It will then compare the fitted model to the experimental data, and display residual plots, sedimentation and diffusion coefficient distributions, as well as molecular weight distributions. These models can be displayed as a 3-D plot showing partial concentrations on a 2-D grid of any of the two folllowing parameters: \\(s\\) , \\(D\\) , \\(f/f_{0}\\) , and MW. The residual plot includes deconvoluted time- and radially- invariant noise plots. All results can be saved.

A polynomial fit to a set of meniscus-RMSD points is plotted and its low point presented as the default new meniscus value. That value - or a manually modified one - can then replace the value in the associated Edited data set. The model with closest meniscus value in the set of fit-meniscus models that were obtained by a front-end or back-end meniscus fit 2DSA run can be preserved, while all other models in the set (and any associated noises) are removed.

It is useful when you want to analyze the same sample under different conditions (for example, different pH levels, or different concentrations). All distributions are plotted relative to the boundary fraction used in analysis. Combine Discrete Distributions This module combines model distributions from multiple datasets, allowing you to compare bar plots of distributions from different cells to each other. Distribution plots present relative concentration (Y) for X, which may be the sedimentation coefficient, molecular weight, diffusion coefficient, frictional ratio, or partial specific density.
