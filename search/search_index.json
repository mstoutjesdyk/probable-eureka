A two-dimensional spectrum analysis for sedimentation velocity experiments of mixtures with heterogeneity in molecular weight and shape. European Biophysics Journal , 39 (3), 405-414. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00249-009-0413-5 An acceptable method for the approzimation for most systems is the model for a mixture of individual non-interacting solutes as described by the Lamm equation. 1 The Lamm Equation 2 descibes the sedimentation and diffusion transport of a single ideal solute in an AUC cell. Therefore, for a mixture of non-interacting solutes, the total concentration \\(C_{T}\\) of all solutes \\(n\\) can be represented by a sum of Lamm equation solutions \\(L\\) : \\[ C_{T} = \\sum^{n}_{i=1} c_{i}L(s_{i}, D_{i}). \\] Finding the correct values of \\(c_{i}\\) , \\(s_{i}\\) , and \\(D_{i}\\) is the challenge when fitting experimental velocity data, and require an optimziation approach that can deal with the non-linearity. One way of doing this is to use iterative fitting methods using non-linear squares optimization. 3 4 [^Schuck1998] But there are drawbacks: the correct model must be selected and verified by user leading to bias in analysis, and; the non-linear least squares tends to break down for systems containing three of more components. This is due to the complexity of the error surface , where simply gradient descent methods fail to navigate the complex, multi-dimensional error surfaces, tending to be traped by local minima, never converging to the global optima. It can also be due to the presence of multiple minima with nearly identical residuals, or the failure to consider additional signals from the inadequacy of the selected models. The C(s) method 5 6 was developed to address these drawbacks by implementing a system linearization avoiding multi-dimensional searchs by iterative methods. In an extention of c(s) method, a regularized searchover a course grid of both \\(s\\) and \\(f/f_{0}\\) was added. The idea behind this linearization method is as follows: the sedimentation ocefficient range is assumed to represened by the solutes in the experiment, divided into equidistant partitions. the diffusion coefficent is treated as a constant and is parameterized with the sedimentation coefficient, \\(s\\) , and frictional ratio, \\(k = f/f_{0}\\) : \\[ D = RT \\left[18\\pi N(k\\eta)^{3/2}\\left(\\frac{s\\bar\\nu}{2(1-\\bar\\nu\\rho)} \\right)^{1/2} \\right]^{-1}. \\] The constant \\(k = f/f_{0}\\) is held constant throughout our \\(C_{T}\\) equation, so that only coefficeint \\(c_{i}\\) need to be determined, while assuming that the coefficients are only greater than or equal to zero. Therefore, for the C(s) method, a single-dimensional non-linear search over \\(k\\) is added to identify an approximate weight average \\(k\\) for \\(\\textbf{all}\\) solutes present. This raises several concerns. First, by treating \\(k\\) to be constant, generality is sacrified. It will only be sufficient for single components, or if all species in a mixture are spherical and the frictinoal ratio is equal to 1. In heterogenous mixtures, when this average frictional ratio value is used to transfform the \\(s\\) -value distrubtion into a molecular weight distribution, there will be an overestimatization of the molecular weight of the most globular component, and an underestimization of the least globular components molecular weight. To address this issue, Brookes and Demeler, amoung others, have explored stochastic search algorithms, with evidencing showing that it is possible to resolve more than two comonents in a mixture with the same level of detail as direct boundary fitting methods. However, these methods require comparatively higher computational efforts, and are impractical for implementing to workstations. Overall, the C( \\(s, f/f_{0}\\) method suffers from: a lack of resolution; large memory needs; producing unnecessarily broad molecular weight distributions, and; 6 introducing false positives caused by noise in the data and by failing to consider the entire parameter space in each minimization step. The 2DSA method is a model-independent approach for fitting sedimentation velocity data which permits simultaneous determination of shape and molecular distributions for mono- and polydisperse solutions of macromolecules. 2DSA is based on fine grained 2-D grid searches over sedimentation coefficients and frictional ratios. The grid is a linear combination of whole boundary models represented by finite element solutions of the Lamm equation. Grid points correspond to the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients present in the Lamm equation. This approach allows for heterogeneity in the frictional domain. This allows for a more faithful description of the experimental data for cases where frictional ratios are not identical for all components. As a result of allowing frictional heterogeneity, the 2DSA method allows for a more reliable molecular weight distributions. Overall, the 2DSA method allows for: globablly fitting multi-speed experiments; the elimination of time- and radially- invarient noise; use on a single work station in a serial implementation or in a parallel computing environment for improved computational seed; superiour accuracy and lower variance fits to experimentat data; identifying modes of aggregation and slow polymerization, and; characterizing confidence limits for determined solutes using Monte Carlo approaches. The examples presented below will demonstrate that, for non-interacting systems, the 2DSA approach is general and model-independent, and does not depend on prior knowledge of the underlying model. For mixtures of rapidly equilibibrating solutes, this approach provides approximations for solutes distributions (although interaction coefficients like equilibiurm and rate constants cannot be obtained). This method also simultaneoulsy resolves heterogeneity in shape and in molecular weight or sedimentation coefficients at a very high resolution, while producing well defined and narrow solute boundaries. Description of Method The 2DSA method is built on the approach of modeling experimental seimentation data by building a two-dimensional grid of frictional ratios and sedimentation coefficients. Using the van Holde-Weischet method or the \\(d\\) C \\(/dt\\) method, one can obtain a knowledge of the fitting limits for \\(s\\) and \\(f/f_{0}\\) , which is the only user input required by the 2DSA. the \\(d\\) C \\(/dt\\) mwrhod is preferred for initialization when there is significant time-invariant noise, as it is superiour in its handling capabilities. To parameterize the diffusion coefficient, it is convinient to use the frictional ratio. Recall the diffusion equation presented above. Using that equation, a unique value for \\(s\\) and \\(D\\) can be defined at each grid point. This can also be used to simulate a velocity exeriment for a species with those specific parameters. To simulate all Lamm equation models, you can use the adaptive space-time finite element solution, 11 and built the sum: \\[ C_{T} = \\sum^{m}_{i}\\sum^{n}_{j} c_{i,j}L[s_{i}, D(s_{i}, k_{j})], \\] where \\(s_{i}\\) is the sedimentaiton coefficient at position \\(i\\) , the fricitonal ratio at \\(j\\) is \\(k_{j}\\) , \\(m\\) is the number of grid points in the sedimentation domain, and \\(n\\) is the number of grid points in the fricitonal ratio domain. The parital concentration of the simulated solutes at grid points \\((i,j)\\) is then \\(c_{i,j}\\) . The minimization problem can be states as the task of finding the minimum for the \\(l^{2}\\) -norm: \\[ \\text{MIN} = \\sum^{h}_{r} \\sum^{l}_{t} [E_{r,t} - C_{Tr,t} ]^{2}, \\] where \\(E_{r,t}\\) referes to teh experimentally determined data points for \\(h\\) radial points \\(r\\) and \\(l\\) time scans \\(t\\) . The minimization problem is solved using the NNLS algorithm, 9 while simultaneoulsy algebraically accounting for the time- and radially- invariant noise contributions in the experimental data.[^SchuckDemeler1999] The linear optimization, in matrix form, is: \\[ \\bf{A}x = \\bf{b}, \\] where \\(\\bf{A}\\) is the matrix of finite element solutions, \\(x\\) is the solution vector containng all coefficients \\(c_{i,j}\\) , and \\(\\bf{b}\\) is the vector of experimental data. MULTI-STAGE REFINEMENT: Lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum. SIMULATION OF GRID ELEMENTS: The ASTFEM solution 10 is used to simulate the Lamm equation solutions for each grid point. You can take advantage of the invariance: \\[ C(as, aD)_{r,t} = C(s,D)_{r,at}, \\] where \\(a\\) is a multiplier that cover the entire desired range of \\(s\\) and \\(D\\) values, to reduce computational effort. ITERATIVE REFINEMENT: Solving the iterative problem involving mutiple low resolution sub-gribs can be empirically shown to be equivalent to solving a high resolution grid covering the same grid points, if the following operations are performed: the non-zero grid points evaluated at the final state are joined with each original grid and processed. The analysis is repeated until convergence is obtained such that an sparse parameter distribution with discrete solutes is identified from the experimental data. Note that this method will not converge to exactly the same solution when time- or radially- invariant noise corrections are performed simulataneously, but these difference are negliable. Example 1 \\(\\textbf{2DSA-Monte Carlo analysis of a 2-component system with heterogeneity in mass and shape}\\) In order to illustrate the ability of the 2DSA method to resolve a system that is heterogeneous in molecular weight and shape, the following system was used. It consisted of: a globular protein (heen egg lyzosyme), and; an elongated molecule (208 bp linear fragment of double-stranded DNA). The lyzosyme has a partial specific volume of 0.724 ccm/g and the DNA has a partial specific volume of 0.55 ccm/g. These molecules were mixed in approximately equally absorbing amounts in 200 mM NaCL and 25 mM TRIS buffer at pH 8.0. The mixture was then run at 42,000 rpm in the standard 2 channel centerpeices, with velocity data collected for 3 hours at 260 nm. Time invariant noise was subtracted so that only stochatic noise would remain in the data. 7 This data was then fitting with the 2DSA method using 50 Monte Carlo iterations, using the iterative refinement method with a maximum of 5 iterations. 8 Figure: 2DSA Monte Carlo Analysis of Velocity Data 2DSA Monte Carlo analysis of velocity data from a mixture of a 208 bp DNA fragment (black lines) and hen egg lysozyme (blue lines). Heavy lines indicate the mean, thin lines represent 95% confidence intervals for the parameter. The results for several parameters from multiple grid resolutions are compared. \\(\\textbf{a}\\) frictional ratio; \\(\\textbf{b}\\) sedimentation coefficient (corrected to standard conditions); \\(\\textbf{c}\\) molecular weight, horizontal lines indicate theoretical molecular weight based on sequence; \\(\\textbf{d}\\) partial concentration and the residual mean square deviation of the fit (red line). Reliable results are obtained after a minimum of 10,000 iterations; higher resolutions do not improve the results significantly. The following observations were made: The 2DSA is a very robust method. Additonal degenergy was introduced when the resolution of the grid was increased but it did not degrade the solutions reliability. The method faithfully reproduces known molecular weights with great precision and accuracy when adjusted for the appropraite partial specific volumes. There is additional benefit derived when using iterative refinements.

At the low resolution, the composition is porrly defined and the solute peaks are split. At higher resolutions, both species are well defined into narrow regions. Noise contributions are well seperated and idenifiable by the upper frictional ratio fitting limit ( \\(k=f/f_{0}\\) =4). The color scale represents the signal of each species in optical density units. Example 2 \\(\\textbf{Multi-speed 2DSA-Monte Carlo analysis of a simulated 5-component system with heterogeneity in mass and shape}\\) The simulated system consisted of equal concentrations of a linearly elongated aggregate and five non-interacting components: monomer (25 kDa, \\(f/f_{0}\\) =1.2); dimer (50 kDa, \\(f/f_{0}\\) =1.4); tetramer (100 kDa, \\(f/f_{0}\\) =1.6); octomer (200 kDa, \\(f/f_{0}\\) =1.8); hexadecamer (400 kDa, \\(f/f_{0}\\) =2.0). Each simulation contained 70 equally spaced scans, resulting in experiment length of ~128 hours at 10 krpm, ~14 hours at 30 krpm, and ~3.5 hours at 60 krpm. Figure: Pseduo-3D plots for 2DSA Monte Carlo Results (Multi-Speed) Pesudo-3D plots for Monte Carlo 2DSA analysis resuls for a simulated five-component system. \\(\\textbf{a}\\) single speed fit (10 krpm), concentional centerpiece; \\(\\textbf{b}\\) single speed fit (60 krpm), conventional centerpiece; \\(\\textbf{c}\\) global multi-speed fit (10, 30, 60 krpm), conventional centerpiece; \\(\\textbf{d}\\) global multi-speed fit (10, 30, 60 krpm), conventional and band-forming Vinograd centerpeice combined. Yellow crosses indicate the position of known solutes that were simulated for the original data. The color scale represents the signal of each species in optical density units. From the multi-speed pseudo-3D plots above, the following observations were made: Single speed fits at 10 krpm with the conventional centerpeice shows poorly resolved signal bands. Single speed fits at 60 krpm with the conventional centerpiece shows more precise defintion of the horizonatal domain, but has a poorly defined frictional range. The global multi-speed fit with the conventional centerpiece eliminates the peak splitting of the medium sized species (tetramer, 100 kDa). However the hexadecamer (400 kDa) was poorly defined with peak splitting. The best fit with full peak splitting resolved is found in the global multi-speed fit when combining data from the conventional centerpiece and the band-forming Vinograd centerpiece. Here, all determined signals fit exceptionally well to the starting parameters. Schuck, P. (2003).

Each simulation contained 70 equally spaced scans, resulting in experiment length of ~128 hours at 10 krpm, ~14 hours at 30 krpm, and ~3.5 hours at 60 krpm.

Yellow crosses indicate the position of known solutes that were simulated for the original data. The color scale represents the signal of each species in optical density units. From the multi-speed pseudo-3D plots above, the following observations were made: Single speed fits at 10 krpm with the conventional centerpeice shows poorly resolved signal bands. Single speed fits at 60 krpm with the conventional centerpiece shows more precise defintion of the horizonatal domain, but has a poorly defined frictional range. The global multi-speed fit with the conventional centerpiece eliminates the peak splitting of the medium sized species (tetramer, 100 kDa). However the hexadecamer (400 kDa) was poorly defined with peak splitting. The best fit with full peak splitting resolved is found in the global multi-speed fit when combining data from the conventional centerpiece and the band-forming Vinograd centerpiece. Here, all determined signals fit exceptionally well to the starting parameters. Schuck, P. (2003).

(2020). A calibration disk for the correction of radial errors from chromatic aberration and rotor stretch in the Optima AUC TM analytical ultracentrifuge. European Biophysics Journal , 49 (8). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00249-020-01434-z To address the issues related to AUC instrument hardware, a calibration disk has been developed as well as experimental procedures and UltraScan modules to carefully measure specific hardware effects and correct them during fitting by calibrations of the chromatic aberration and rotor stretch. Calibration Disk Design The calibration disk has a geometry with two sector-shapped channels, each divided into seven open sectors for each channel, and six ribes. Each sector is 3.7-degrees wide, wider than a standard 2-channel epon-charcoal centerpiece, which is only 2.5-degrees wide, and is offset by 0.9-degrees from the centerline. A guide note (1.6 mm x 0.5 mm) is included to ensure proper alignment in the cell housing. The following requirements were considered when designing this disk. We want to maximize the number of edges, so that we could allow for a greater number of position replicates, thus allowing for improved statistics of a rotor stretch protocol. The openings were designed to be at least 500 um wide to prevent overlaps in the inner and outer edge position recordings. The ribs were at least 100 um wide, to ensure sufficient stability when the rotor is spinning at high speeds. The Optima AUC uses a photo-multiplier tube to detect light passing through the sample. The instrument adjusts the photo-multiplier voltage based on the opaqueness of the sample. The UV detector performs this check at 65.0 mm in the center of the reference channel. It is important to ensure that the light path is never blocked at this position; if it were, the photo-multiplier voltage would be set to the maximum gain, flooding the detector with too much light in the open sections. Therefore, we created the 4th open section (center hole) to be positioned in such a way that there will be an opening for the light intensity calibration, regardless of any rotor stretch. Thus, we can assume that the photo-multiplier voltage will always be set to an appropriate amount, irrespective of wavelength or rotor stretch. At each rotor speed, a delay-time calibration procedure is performed to determine the precise angle of the rotor, and to find the sample cell channels. The instrument is programmed to use to find the counterbalance's inner calibration hole, and uses them to obtain a precise angle for the calibration hole. To replicate this feature, the innermost open sector is longer, and position in the same position as the calibration holes of the counterbalance. This permits the calibration disk to be used for delay calibration purposes as well. The shape of the edges follow the circle of their radii, and the sectors are wider than standard centerpieces. This minimizes any error from lamp flash timing, while improving radial recording accuracy. Both sectors are mirror images of each other. Scanning in intensity mode allows each sector to be scanned as a separate image, and the calibration results from both sectors can be compared for agreement. Any disagreement between the two sector's edge positions indicate an alignment issue with the disk, and thus it can be used as a guide to correct the alignment notch of either the cell housing or the rotor. The edge positions of our design has been verified by scanning the disk on a high-resolution flatbed scanner. Using correct spacer rings, our disk can be positioned precisely in the focus position of the light path for optimal imaging accuracy of the edge positions. Specifically, the calibration disk is installed between two windows, and positioned in at 2/3 of the optical plane of the 1.2 cm AUC cell housing. Manufacturing Laser cutting, 3D printing, and CNC machining were all tested for the manufacturing of the disk. 3D printing was considered because it was previously used for centerpieces, 1 but was too imprecise and lacked sufficient rigidity at 0.5 mm thickness for our needs (see figure on right). Additionally, thicker material produced measurable issues with shading on one side of the edge, suggesting that the incident beam is not perfectly perpendicular to the focus plane. In the end, we found that CNC machining produced the most reproducible and accurate results. A Sherline 3 axis Bench Top CNC Mill with a tolerance of +- 0.0005 cm, featuring a solid carbide slotting end mill, were used to produce the calibration disks from 0.5 mm brass shim stock. All disks were manufactured by Geoff Minors of Technical Services of the University of Lethbridge.The predicted positions of the edges were verfied using a flatbed scanner with 3200 DPI optical resolution (~8 um), by determining the actual edge positions using standard Euclidean geometry, while assuming the center of the disk to be located at 65 mm.

For cells with a 3-mm centerpiece, two spacers are required. Each component is designed with a special key on the housing, and a key-way on the other parts, which will all fit together to provide accurate alignment. Centerpieces The sector-shaped sample compartments that are used are esential in velocity experiments as the sedimenting particles will move along radial lines. If the components had parallel walls, the molecules would collide with the walls as they sedimented. DOUBLE SECTOR: the sample solution can be placed in one sector, with the second sector for reference material (this sector is filled slightly more than the sample, so that the reference meniscus does not obscure profiles). SIX-CHANNEL EQUILIBIRUM BOUNDARY FORMING: these cells allow the solvent to be layed over a sample while the cell is spinning at a moderately slow speed. These cells can prepare artifical sharp boundaries for measuring doundary spreaduring in measurements of diffusion coefficients, and for examining sedimentation velocity of small molecules (where the rate of sedimentation cannot create a sharp boundary to clear the meniscus). SIX-CHANNEL EQUILIBIURM (EXTERNAL FILL) BAND FORMING: these cells allow for the layering of a small volume of solution on the top of a supporting density gradient. (Cohen and Mire, 1971; Kemper and Everse, 1973) Windows Both quartz and sapphire windows can be used in the analytical cells. Sapphire windows are specifically recommended to use with the interference optical system, as they allow for good fringe patterns at speeds above 30,000 rpm because they produce less light refraction. However, they can block the transmission of light below ~240 nm. The window assembly components are compatible with both window types. Handle the windows with care. Do not scratch them; this immediately discommmision them. The sapphire windows are heavier and harder than the quartz windows, and thus expected to have a longer life. They may have an \"x\" etched on the side to differentiate them. If not, use their weights to determine their type. It is very important for the quartz windows to have an absorbance of less than 0.1 AU in the 190 to 800 nm range. Check the absorbance yearly by: 1) cleaning the window and checking that it is clear and not damaged, and; 2) using a spectrophotometer to check the window absorbance. This is done by running a background wavelength scan fro 190 nm to 800 nm with nothing in the light's path. Now, place the window in the path of the light and scan the same wavelength range. Cell Housings Lorem Ipsum Cell Assembly Before assembling your analytical cells: Wash and dry new components. Insepct all componets. Replece any if they show signs of damage or wear. Check that the scew-ring threads are clean and free of burs. The scew-ring washers should be clear, and not deformed. Check the window holders. They should not be distored. The window gaskets should be clean, and the window liners should not be frayed at the edges. The window gasket should be checked and changed when it becomes transparent, indicating compression. The window liner is placed so that the open end is opposite of the alignment mark and the window inserted with the arrow lined up with the key-way. The window should fit snugly. If it does not, the liner should be changed. Check the windows for any scratches or cracks. If necessary and the scratches/cracks are in areas that do not cover the sector, the windows can be used. Check that the windows are clean. There should not be any fingerprints, smudges, dust, or lint. Once they are clean, handle them with a lintless tisure, holding them by the edges only. The centerpices should have un-damanged faces and septum walls. Check that the cell-housing threads are clean, the housing key-way is not nicked, the filling holes are clean, and the housing itself is not defromed. When using more than 1 analytical cells, ensure that opposing cells contain the same type of centerpiece and are within 0.5 grams of each other. Once these inspections and checks are completed, the cell assembly can begin. STEP 1: ASSEMBLE WINDOWS Insert a window gasket into the window holder. Place the liner in the holder, over the gasket. The gap in the liner should be opposite from the key-way. Think of the direction of force and how the liner cushions the window. Carefull insert the clean window into the holder. Repeat as necessary. STEP 2: STACK CENTERPIECE AND WINDOW ASSEMBLIES The bottom window assembly is pushed down to the bottom of the housing, window side up, aligning the key-way with they key,the centerpiece inserted part number right side up, and the top window assembly inserted. Stack the centerpeice and the final window assembly (window down), and push them down. For 3-mm centerpieces, a space must be inserted before the bottom window assembly. The second spacer is placed above the top window. Do not force any of the components down into the housing. If they do not slide down easily, check for anything that is hindering their movement. STEP 3: INSERT SCREW RING INTO HOUSING AND TIGHTEN Place the screw ring gasket and screw ring into the top. The side inscribed \"OUT\" should be facing up. The screw ring can be manually turned, and then finished using a cell assembly tool. Remember that the screw has a buttress thread, and forcing the ring to screw in the wrong direction will strip the threads. Place the analytical cell into the cell torque collet. Torque to 125 pound inches. Do not over-torque, as this may lead to warping of the cell or crushing of the windows. Remove the torque from the collet and remove the cell from the vise only touching the housing. STEP 4: FILL CENTERPIECES, AND SEAL Cells can be loaded using either a pipette or a syringe and tubing. Pipetting involves stacking a round, gel-loading tip into a 1000 ul tip to load the 450 ul of sample. Standard Double-Sector: Each sector can hold 0.46 mL. Hold the cell horizontly with the screw ring end facing you and the filling holes up. The reference sector is on the left; the right sector is for the sample-solvent mixture in Absorbance experiments. You can add a greater volume to the reference sector so that the meniscus is easily recognized. Six-Channel Equilibirum (External Fill): Synthetic Boundary (capillary-type): Band Forming: Once the samples are loaded, a small gasket must be placed over the hole and a small brass screw is placed overin the hole and tightened. The centrifugal force will push the gaskets into the fill holes to seal them. Over-tightening of the screw can cause warping to the cell housing and make it difficult to push into the rotor hole. General advice: air must be allowed to escape the chambers as fluid is pushed into the centerpiece; otherwise, fluid will spill out. Concentrated samples and those containing detergents may be difficult to load. Be continual and slow with your injection. STEP $: WEIGH ASSEMBLED CELLS AND PREPARE COUNTERBALANCE Weigh your assembled cells. Opposing cells should weigh within 0.5 grams of each other. Match the weight of the cell that will be opposite to the counterbalance to the weight of the counterbalance. You can use weights to match. This is done by screwing the weight into the weight attachement hole at the top of the counterbalance. For a 0.5 gram weight, it can be screwed into the weight attachement hole at the bottom of the counterbalance. Do not have any weights protruding out of the top or bottom of the counterbalance. They should be flush; protruding weights can get sheared off during centrifugation. STEP 6: LOAD ROTOR Place the counterbalance in its cell hole (cell 4 for An-60 Ti, cell 8 for An-50 Ti). The arrow on the counterbalance should be pointing away from the center of rotation. If the counterbalance is loose, use a small allen wrench to tighten the setscrew. Install each assembled cell into their respective holes with the screw ring up, and the housing filling holes toward the center of the rotor. Match the scribe line on each cell with the scribe line on the rotor hole. Make sure the cell fits snuggly into the cell hole. Finally, the rotor assembly can be placed on the spindle inside the chamber of the AUC, the proper optics installed, and placing the lid. With the last sliding door closed, the vacuum can be turned on. Once a run has been complete, the cell disassembly process can begin. If you have a machine capable of cleaning the cells without disassembly, it is not necessary to take them apart. Otherwise the procedure is such: Unscrew and remove the housing gaskets. Remove the plug gaskets with forcepts and discard them. Do not scratch the centerpiece. If necessary, cells with external filling holes can be emptied after the removal of the plug screws and gaskets, but before disassembling the entire cell. Generally, stable cells can be removed this way, making AUC a non-destructive analysis method. Loosen the screw-ring using the cell torque wrench. Remove the ring and washer. Place the cell threaded-end down. Push the components out by pressing them down with your finger, while lifting the housing up. Push the windows out of hte holders, and thoroughly wash and dry all components. Clean and dry the centerpeices. Store all components in a dust-free environment. Cleaning Cell windows and centerpieces should be cleaned after every run. MACHINE WASHING: lorem ipsum. HAND WASHING: Wipe the cell windows with a lintless tissue. Wash the centerpeices by soaking them in warm distilled water. If cell leakage has occured (see below), make sure to disassembly the entire cell and clean all components in a mild detergent solution. Rinse the cleaned components and dry them thoroghly to prevent corrosion. Cell Leakage Cell leakage is a possible issue that may occur when running an AUC experiment. Massive leaks where the sample leaves the cell will cause a temporarty loss in chamber vacuum. This will be reported as a diagnostic message on the display screen of the instrument. This is one indication of cell leakage. Another is from observing incoming data scans; the menisucs will shift/disappear toward the cell bottom as sample leaves. FILLING HOLE LEAKS: These leaks result from the fill hole gaskets not completely sealing the holes. LEAKS ACROSS THE FACE OF THE CENTERPIECE: These leaks are a result of scatches on the centerpiece or windows, or from inadquate tightening of the cell housing/screw ring. SECTOR TO SECTOR LEAKS: These leaks occur only when the fill levels differ by more than 5 ul. This is indicated by meniscus shifting or disappearing. Keep in mind that similar fill volumes reduces the stress of the wall between the sectors, minimizing damage and leaking. In the six-channel centerpeices, leaking can occur between channels in the direction of the centrigual force. This is identified by a change in the position of the meniscus. If leakage is due to a damaged centerpeice, replace the centerpeice and discard the damaged piece. Counterbalances The counterbalance is typically coloured anodized red, and must be positioned in hole 4 for the An-60 Ti rotor, and hole 8 for the An-50 Ti rotor. They must be in those positions because it is at those positions where the machine calibrates its radial distances. To balance the opposing cell, the counterbalance will come with weights. Ensure that the weight is within 0.5 grams. A small setscrew in the top of the counterbalance can be used to secure the counterbalance in the rotor. Align the counterbalance using the tick marks on the rotor and the counterbalance housing and then tighten the screw to hold it in position. For the counterbalance calibration, see something else?

An analytical ultracentrifuge can 'watch' molecules while they are seperating and indentify and differentiate them by their hydrodynamic properties and partial concentration. AUC works by applying a centrifugal force, causing molecules to become seperated based on their bouyant mass and their frictional properties. The molecules can be observed using different optical systems that detect the different properites of the molecules. Virtually any molecule, colloid, or particle that can be dissolved in a liquid can be measured by AUC, as long as it does not sediment by gravity alone. The molecule or particle can be as small as a salt ion, or as large as an entire virus particle. EXAMPLE: Determine Sedimentation Coefficient Consider an initially homogenous solution. It is centrifugated at 70,000 rpm. The absorbance profile at 230 nm is measured over time, writen as [time(hr), A \\(_{plataeu}\\) ]: [0,2.04], [1,1.84], [2,1.66], [3,1.50], [5,1.22], [8,0.90], [12,0.60]. What is the sedimenation coefficient of the particle? SOLUTION: Lorem Ipsum EXAMPLE: Determining a Protein's Molecular Weight Consider a protein that is ran in a rotor at a speed of 12,000 rpm at 4-degrees C. It is in a dilute aqueous buffer whose density is that of water. When the absorbance profile is measured, it produces the following data: If the proteins partial specific volume is 0.740 cm \\(^{3}\\) /g, what is its molecular weight? Solution: M = 57,800 Da When a solute is suspended in a solent, it is subject to several different forces. First, we have the sedimenting/graviational force. This force is proportional to the mass of the particle and the acceleration is it experiencing. When considering a spinning rotor, this is the centrifugal force: \\[ F_{c} = \\frac{mv_{tang}^{2}}{r} = m r \\omega^{2}. \\] Here, \\(r\\) is the distance from the axis of rotation (cm), \\(v_{tang}\\) is the linear velocity perpendicular to the radial axis (m/s \\(^{2}\\) ), and \\(\\omega\\) is the angular velocity (radians/second). \\[\\bf{Remember:~~~ 1 ~RPM = \\frac{2\\pi}{60} ~rad/sec.}\\] We can write it in terms of molar weight, \\(M\\) (g/mol), and Avogadro's number, \\(N\\) . \\[ F_{c} = \\frac{M}{N}\\omega^{2}r. \\] DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CENTRIFUGAL AND CENTRIPETAL: Centrifugal: in the rotating reference frame of the rotor. Centripetal: in the labratory reference frame. We can compare this force to the graviational force that is felt on the earth's surface. Let the radius of the earth be \\(r_{e} = 6.30 \\times 10^{8} cm\\) , the mass of the earth be \\(m_{e} = 5.976 \\times 10^{27}\\) g. Then, F_{g} = \\frac{G m_e m}{r_{e}^{2}}, with \\(G = 6.67 \\times 10^{-8}\\) cm \\(^{3}\\) /sec \\(^{2}\\) is the universal gravitational constant. <span style=\"color: #d9534f;\"EXAMPLE: Determine Centrifugal Force at Radius, r Consider a rotor spinning at 45,000 rpm. What is its centrifugal force at a radius of 5 cm? Write as a multiple of the gravitational force. Solution: The second force acting on the solute is the buoyant force, \\(F_{b}\\) : \\[ F_{b}= -m\\bar\\nu\\rho_{0}\\omega^{2}r = \\frac{M}{N} \\bar\\nu \\rho \\omega^{2} r \\] where we have \\(\\bar\\nu\\) to be the partial specific volume (or the inverse of the solute's effective density), and \\(\\rho\\) is the density of the solute. Sedimentation occurs when the density of the particle is greater than that of the solvent. As the solute moves towards the bottom of the cell, it will expereince an increase in velocity, due to the increasing radial distance (the force is proportional to radius). As it moves through the fluid, the solute will experience a frictional drag proportional to its velocity. The frictional force is: \\[ F_{f} = -f v \\] where \\(f\\) is the frictional coefficent. This coefficent is dependent on the shape and size of the solute: bulky or elongated particles will experience a greater fricitonal drag compared to the drag expereinced by compact, smooth spherical particles. The negative sign in the equations for buoyancy and frictional drag indicate that these forces are acting opposite to the sedimentation force. As the rotor is spun up, the forces aboce will come into balance: \\[ \\sum F = F_{c} + F_{b} + F_{f} = 0, \\] \\[ \\frac{M}{N}\\omega^{2} - \\frac{M}{N} \\bar\\nu\\rho\\omega^{2}r - f v = 0, \\] \\[ \\frac{M}{N}(1-\\bar\\nu\\rho)\\omega^{2}r - fu = 0. \\] Let us now create the term \\(v/\\omega^{2}r\\) to represent the sedimentation coefficient, or the velocity of a particle per unit of gravitational acceleration. \\[ \\frac{M(1-\\bar\\nu\\rho)}{Nf} = \\frac{v}{\\omega^{2}r} \\equiv s. \\] Note how this coefficient is proportional to the buoyant effective molar weight and is inversely proportional to the frictional coefficient. The sedimentation coefficent has dimensions of seconds, \\(s\\) , and the Svedberg unit, \\(S\\) , is defined at 10 \\(^{-13}\\) seconds. As sedimentation piles the solutes at the bottom of the cell, the concentration at that point will increase, and the process of diffusion will oppose further sedimentation. After an appropriate amount of time, diffusion and sedimentation will approach an equilibrium point and the concentration of the solute will have an exponential increase towards the bottom of the cell. The concentration distribution from the top of the cell to the bottom will no longer change over time and is now a function of molecular weight. Recall that sedimentation depends on the effective molar weight, corrected for buoyancy. Consider the following cases: \\(\\rightarrow\\) If the density of the solute is \\(\\textbf{greater}\\) than that of the solvent, the solute will sediment. \\(\\rightarrow\\) If the density of the solute is \\(\\textbf{less}\\) than that of the solvent, the solute will float. \\(\\rightarrow\\) If the density of the solute is \\(\\textbf{equal}\\) to that of the solvent, the solute will not move. Here, we can use this situation to determine the density of a macromolecule in a desnity gradient sedimentation experiemnt. The frictional coefficient, \\(f\\) , depends on the shape and size of the moving particle. When considering the simple case of a spherical particle, we assume the Stokes-Einstein, \\[ f = \\frac{kT}{D} = \\frac{RT}{ND}, \\] and the Stokes equation to hold, \\[ f = 3 \\pi \\eta d, \\] where \\(k\\) is the Boltzmann number, \\(R\\) is the universal gas constant, and \\(d\\) is the diameter of a spherical particle. Using the formulas above, we can derive the famous Svedberg equation for determining \\(M\\) if \\(s\\) , \\(D\\) , and \\(\\bar\\nu\\) are knonw: \\[ M = \\frac{sRT}{D(1-\\bar\\nu\\rho)}. \\]","title":"Centrifugation"},{"location":"centri/#analytical-ultracentrifugation","text":"Analytical ultracentrifugation is technique that can seperate macrmolecule that are suspended in solution in a centrifugal force field.

When considering a spinning rotor, this is the centrifugal force: \\[ F_{c} = \\frac{mv_{tang}^{2}}{r} = m r \\omega^{2}. \\] Here, \\(r\\) is the distance from the axis of rotation (cm), \\(v_{tang}\\) is the linear velocity perpendicular to the radial axis (m/s \\(^{2}\\) ), and \\(\\omega\\) is the angular velocity (radians/second). \\[\\bf{Remember:~~~ 1 ~RPM = \\frac{2\\pi}{60} ~rad/sec.}\\] We can write it in terms of molar weight, \\(M\\) (g/mol), and Avogadro's number, \\(N\\) . \\[ F_{c} = \\frac{M}{N}\\omega^{2}r. \\] DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CENTRIFUGAL AND CENTRIPETAL: Centrifugal: in the rotating reference frame of the rotor. Centripetal: in the labratory reference frame. We can compare this force to the graviational force that is felt on the earth's surface. Let the radius of the earth be \\(r_{e} = 6.30 \\times 10^{8} cm\\) , the mass of the earth be \\(m_{e} = 5.976 \\times 10^{27}\\) g. Then, F_{g} = \\frac{G m_e m}{r_{e}^{2}}, with \\(G = 6.67 \\times 10^{-8}\\) cm \\(^{3}\\) /sec \\(^{2}\\) is the universal gravitational constant. <span style=\"color: #d9534f;\"EXAMPLE: Determine Centrifugal Force at Radius, r Consider a rotor spinning at 45,000 rpm. What is its centrifugal force at a radius of 5 cm? Write as a multiple of the gravitational force. Solution: The second force acting on the solute is the buoyant force, \\(F_{b}\\) : \\[ F_{b}= -m\\bar\\nu\\rho_{0}\\omega^{2}r = \\frac{M}{N} \\bar\\nu \\rho \\omega^{2} r \\] where we have \\(\\bar\\nu\\) to be the partial specific volume (or the inverse of the solute's effective density), and \\(\\rho\\) is the density of the solute. Sedimentation occurs when the density of the particle is greater than that of the solvent. As the solute moves towards the bottom of the cell, it will expereince an increase in velocity, due to the increasing radial distance (the force is proportional to radius). As it moves through the fluid, the solute will experience a frictional drag proportional to its velocity. The frictional force is: \\[ F_{f} = -f v \\] where \\(f\\) is the frictional coefficent. This coefficent is dependent on the shape and size of the solute: bulky or elongated particles will experience a greater fricitonal drag compared to the drag expereinced by compact, smooth spherical particles. The negative sign in the equations for buoyancy and frictional drag indicate that these forces are acting opposite to the sedimentation force. As the rotor is spun up, the forces aboce will come into balance: \\[ \\sum F = F_{c} + F_{b} + F_{f} = 0, \\] \\[ \\frac{M}{N}\\omega^{2} - \\frac{M}{N} \\bar\\nu\\rho\\omega^{2}r - f v = 0, \\] \\[ \\frac{M}{N}(1-\\bar\\nu\\rho)\\omega^{2}r - fu = 0. \\] Let us now create the term \\(v/\\omega^{2}r\\) to represent the sedimentation coefficient, or the velocity of a particle per unit of gravitational acceleration. \\[ \\frac{M(1-\\bar\\nu\\rho)}{Nf} = \\frac{v}{\\omega^{2}r} \\equiv s. \\] Note how this coefficient is proportional to the buoyant effective molar weight and is inversely proportional to the frictional coefficient. The sedimentation coefficent has dimensions of seconds, \\(s\\) , and the Svedberg unit, \\(S\\) , is defined at 10 \\(^{-13}\\) seconds. As sedimentation piles the solutes at the bottom of the cell, the concentration at that point will increase, and the process of diffusion will oppose further sedimentation. After an appropriate amount of time, diffusion and sedimentation will approach an equilibrium point and the concentration of the solute will have an exponential increase towards the bottom of the cell. The concentration distribution from the top of the cell to the bottom will no longer change over time and is now a function of molecular weight. Recall that sedimentation depends on the effective molar weight, corrected for buoyancy. Consider the following cases: \\(\\rightarrow\\) If the density of the solute is \\(\\textbf{greater}\\) than that of the solvent, the solute will sediment. \\(\\rightarrow\\) If the density of the solute is \\(\\textbf{less}\\) than that of the solvent, the solute will float. \\(\\rightarrow\\) If the density of the solute is \\(\\textbf{equal}\\) to that of the solvent, the solute will not move. Here, we can use this situation to determine the density of a macromolecule in a desnity gradient sedimentation experiemnt. The frictional coefficient, \\(f\\) , depends on the shape and size of the moving particle. When considering the simple case of a spherical particle, we assume the Stokes-Einstein, \\[ f = \\frac{kT}{D} = \\frac{RT}{ND}, \\] and the Stokes equation to hold, \\[ f = 3 \\pi \\eta d, \\] where \\(k\\) is the Boltzmann number, \\(R\\) is the universal gas constant, and \\(d\\) is the diameter of a spherical particle. Using the formulas above, we can derive the famous Svedberg equation for determining \\(M\\) if \\(s\\) , \\(D\\) , and \\(\\bar\\nu\\) are knonw: \\[ M = \\frac{sRT}{D(1-\\bar\\nu\\rho)}. \\]","title":"Analytical Ultracentrifugation"},{"location":"chose-optics/","text":"How do you chose what optical system to use? The logistics of each optical system has already been discussed here . Here, advantages and disadvantages of each system is presented, as well as some considerations to be aware of. The choice varies depending on your sample: what are the components? what is the concentration? Absorbance Optics OPTICAL DENSITY: Boasts a lower limit of ~0.1 OD due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (optimal at 230 nm). Generally should not be used for samples with an optical density above 1.0 OD. At that point, there may be non-linearity of the absorbance signal. WAVELENGTHS: Use lower wavelengths for small protein concentrations. Protein extinction is usually 3-10 fold better when using 230 nm over 280 nm. Do not measure at concentrations above 0.9-1.0 O.D. Check extinction profiles of your sample. In SV-AUC, do not change the wavelength mid-run. When measuring multiple concentrations at different wavelengths, perform multiple runs. For DNA and DNA-protein complexes: scanning at 260 nm enables much lower sample concentrations, due to the high extinction profiles of DNA. BUFFERS: Buffers should not absord, or only a very little. This requirement can mean that you must exclud strong UV-absorbing species such as DTT. Always check aborbance again a water blank to confirm the level of baseline absorbance. Most of the signal should come from the sample, not the buffer. All together, both analyte and bufffer should not exceed the dynamic range of the detector. INTENSITY VS ABSORBANCE MODE: Measuring in Intensity Mode vs. Absorbance Mode Cn be used to measure samples in the reference channel as long as the total OD is less than 0.5 OD to avoid resetting of PMT setting. In general, fill centerpiece as full as possible (~0.46 ml), but leave some room above the meniscus to provide an air region for intensity referencing. Requires time/radially invariant noise removal by fitting with 2DSA . Reduces stochastic noise by a factor of the square root of 2. Provides absolute intensity data to check instrument performance. When designing AUC experiments for UV optics it is highly recommended to measure in intensity rather than absorbance mode. Unlike absorbance data, intensity data is not convoluted with the random noise acquired in a reference measurement, producing better fits with lower RMSD values. In the process of collecting absorbance data in the Beckman XL-A, the reference channel data is subtracted from the sample channel data, thereby convoluting the random noise from the reference channel with the random noise from the sample channel. Whenever two noisy vectors are added or subtracted from each other, the noise level increases by the square root of 2, or a factor of ~ 1.4. The UltraScan software used in our laboratory is perfectly capable of accurately calculating the baseline levels of any experimental dataset using established algorithms, so a reference subtraction as done in absorbance experiments is no longer needed. There are other advantages: In intensity mode both channels are scanned into separate datasets, making it possible to double the capacity of the instrument by using both channels for samples. There is only one catch: The OD in the reference channel must be less than 0.5 OD (as detected in a 1.2 cm pathlength cell), regardless of wavelength, to prevent a resetting of the photomultiplier gain set. If the total OD (including baseline absorbance compared to ddH2O) is less than 0.5 OD, the gainsets will not be changed. A gainset adjustment in the XLA during the experiment has important consequences: The data will be rescaled at a different scale, the baselines will shift, and the entire experimental data can no longer be globally analyzed in a single fit. Each dataset acquired at a different gainset needs to be analyzed separately (although the individual datasets can still be combined to be analyzed in a global fit). But this is tedious and inconvenient. This limitation actually works in our favor: For many proteins it is interesting to study the protein at different concentrations. If a protein is reversibly self-associating, measuring a 0.3 and a 0.9 OD concentration under the same conditions will reveal mass action effects and tell us if the protein is self-associating. Hence, it is advisable to always measure at least two concentrations of each sample (0.3 and 0.9 OD, as measured in a standard 1.0 cm pathlength cuvette), with the 0.3 OD sample placed into the reference channel, and the 0.9 OD sample into the sample channel. Advantages Great for low concentrations of proteins or nucleic acids Always good to measure at lower concentrations; molecules sediment and diffuse ideally, and you avoid concentration-dependent non-ideality. Uses absorbance maximum. Where do you get the most signal? Pick those wavelengths. Flexible wavelength selection. Second channel can be used another sample in intensity mode. supports MWL-AUC on Optima. Disadvantages Slow scanning speed (worse on XL-A). slit assembly motor is much faster than servo-motor. Monochromator does not reset properly, so you can only use one wavelength (XL-A only) Intensity variation as a function of wavelength (see Xenon Lamp Maintenance ). Sensitive to refractive artifacts causing distortions in radial position. Worse for higher refractive solutions. Buffers should be non-absorbing Rayleigh Interference Optics Has a lower sample concetration limit (~0.1 mg/ml) but can allow for the use of much more concentrated samples. Will observe the signal for all buffer components; requiring the subtration of buffer components using reference samples. Advantages Great for samples with high refractive indices. Fast scanning speed, measuring every 5 seconds. No temporal distortion. One snapshot for each hole. Good for fast sedimenting samples. high radial resolution, low stochastic noise no buffer interference, allowing for arbitrary buffers to be use. Disadvantages Sensite to refractive index artifacts such as wiener skewing and lens effect Use shorter path length or have lower concentrations to avoid wiener skewing. Exact meniscus match required between buffer channel and sample channel to measure refractive index differences. Sample must be dialyzed or column purified. Buffer components may sediment and change the concentration over time of the cell, and adds a singal. Lower capacity: second channel cannot be used for a seperate sample. Only 3 cells for An-60, 7 cells for An-50. Needs counterbalance. Fluorescence Optics (488 nm) Generally enhances the dynamic rane by extending into the low end of sample concentration into the low nano molar, depending on labeling efficiency and fluorophore quantum yield. the minimal FDS power setting still enable the use of low-micromolar concentrations Zhao et al 2014 report that fluorescent optics can provide uable data for concentrations as low micro-molar. LABELING REQUIREMENTS: fluorphores with 488-nm exitation maxima are ideal to use, but other dyes can be used if they have higher final concentrations for producing a singal equivalent to samples with the 488-nm excitation maxima. When labing native functional groups, make sure that its behavior is equivalent to that of the unlabelled protein. Advantages Exquisite selectivity to measure tagged molecule and can be used against an impure background Very high sensitivity (down to pM concentrations) No refractive artifacts Fast scanning speed (all cells and channels are scanned simultaneously) No buffer interference Great for hetero-interactions, in-vivo studies, GFP fusions proteins.

PLoS ONE . https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126420 Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) are a set of operating and instrument standards which dictate a processes control requirements and documentation. GMP environments provide assurances to the consumer and any regulatory agencies that: a. best practices were followed; b. results are validated, and can be audited; c. quality standards are observed, and; d. any risks are minimized throughout the procedure. GMP Obstacles in AUC Within the AUC lab, there are several issues that can be determined which affect the authenticity of data analysis procedures. Human error can be found in the form of the manual process of sample handling and AUC cell loading. There is a certain dexterity that is required to achieve reproducible loading volumes, as well as proper alignment of cells in the rotor. While the AUC is a highly sophisticated instrument, it comes with a large number of operational variable, which would need individual validation, before their effect on results can be minimized. There is weakness in the chain of data custody. This impairs the audit trail, and can allow for potential manipulation/falsification of primary research data. For example, the traditional data acquisition software is disconnected from the analysis process, and thus requires manual data transfer between multiple computers. Traditional data acquisition is performed on undocumented software. This software is often closed-source freeware, preventing any source code auditing, leaving no assurances for the users that the software follows any stringent GMP documentation requirements. Important parameters are not routinely checked for consistency. Resolution information content is affected by: number of scans in the experiment, duration of experiment, loading volume, and column length. Loading concentration can affect the mass action of reversible systems and non-ideality parameters. Chromatic aberration can cause incorrect radial reporting when recording wavelengths. Data quality is not checked for consistency. Data editing, analysis algorithms, and analysis parameters can be left up to an user to change at will. Data interpretation is affected by analysis parameters (grid size, grid resolution, edited data ranges, buffer corrections) and hardware parameters (rotor stretch corrections). Reporting is not an automated process. The processing of data is manual and based on a subjective interpretation of results. That interpretation does not necessarily include standard metrics for comparison that can be automated and applied without user bias. Hardware Effects A recent multi-labratory study demonstrated the importance of accurate reference materials to provide improved validation for the AUC. 1 Accurate reference materials are also useful in that they will complement the resolution gains offered by modern analysis software.

We noticed that the Lamm Equation was being solved with incorrect boundary conditions. Typically, we expect the bottom of the cell to be routinely held constant at the known position at rest. However, the absolute radial position of the sample cell was shifting. Finite element solutions of the Lamm Equation require accurate knowledge of the boundary consitions, which include the radial positions of the meniscus and bottom location ofthe sample cell. Any error in these boundary conditions, or the absolute radial positionscollected will affect the fitte values of the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients. This error propogates to the calculations of biomolecular attributes. Stretching or contracting of the rotor changes these boundary conditions, and thus must be known. Specifically, the titanium rotors, when spun at very high speeds, were stretching a finite amount, changing the boundary conditions of the experiment compared to those at rest or a different speed. Consider the figure to the right: this is a temperture-time graph for a rotor spinning from rest to 60,000 RPM, resting for 15 mins, and then decelerating back down to rest. Notice how there is a temperature decrease intially as the rotor accelerates; the acceleration period takes ~5 minutes. As the speed increases the rotor needs energy to stretch out and so it takes it from its environment. The chamber will notice this change and correct the temperature to the stated temperature. This correction occurs while to rotor spins at 60,000 RPM for 15 minutes. After this time has elapsed, the rotor spins down to rest and no longer needs the heat energy it took from the environment and so it releases it, causing an increases in temperature. Again, the chamber will correct for this change. The valley and peak have approximately the same area, and this change in temperature is adiabatic.

Raman Scattering vs. Fluoresence Describe a way (either steady-state or time-resolved) to distinguish Raman scattering from fluorescence. Using ladder and Feynman diagrams for fluorescence (F) and Raman Scattering (R). We define the ground state by \\(\\ket{1}\\bra{1}\\) , the vibrationally excited state (VES) by \\(\\ket{2}\\bra{2}\\) , and the electroniclly excited state (EES) by \\(\\ket{1'}\\bra{1'}\\) . Generally, both fluorescence and Raman scattering can be explain in two interactions, as shown in the figure on the right. There will be some incident light, \\(\\omega_1\\) , which will excite an electron from the ground state to the EES. Spontaneous emission occurs in the form of \\(\\omega_2\\) when there is a transition from the EES to the VES. in fluorescence, \\(\\omega_2\\) can be refered to as the fluorescence frequency; in Raman scattering, \\(\\omega_2\\) is known as the scattered frequency. Note that in both fluorescence and Raman scattering, the direction of \\(\\omega_2\\) will be random (the phton will be emitted in all directions in space). The figures directly below is a representation of four interactions in the form of ladder diagrams and Feynman diagrams. To help with understanding these diagrams, reference this table: For Raman scattering specifically, we have intensities, \\(\\omega_1, \\omega_2\\) , which are sometimes referred to as the 'pump' and 'probe', respectively. The order of interactions are: \\[ \\omega_1 \\rightarrow \\omega_1^* \\rightarrow \\omega_2 \\rightarrow \\omega_2^* \\] During stimulated Raman emission, these interactions essentially amoun to losing the 'pump' photon and gaining a 'probe' photon. For fluorescence, the order of interaction is: \\[ \\omega_1 \\rightarrow \\omega_2 \\rightarrow \\omega_1^* \\rightarrow \\omega_2^* \\] We know that if the energy of a photon is greater or equal to the differene between the ground state and the excited state (it is resonant with a molecular transition), the molecule can absorb that photon and undergo a transition. In this excited state, the molecule has several options: it may lose some or all of its energy in an interaction with another molecules; it may fall apart if the extra energy is too much, or; it may emit the extra energy as a photon. This last case is known as fluorescence and is the result of that resonant process. Raman scattering, on the other hand, is not a resonant process. Rather, the energy of the photon is not of particular importance. A molecule will recieve EM radiation and re-radiate it This will typically be at the same energy needed for Rayleigh scattergin. Sometimes some of the energy is stored as molecular vibrational energy, and if the molecule is already in an vibrationally excited state, the energy will be emitted as a photon, with the scattered light seeing a shift in the wavelength from its incident EM radiation. This is demonstrated below.

For fluorescence, this element implies no vibrational coherence with a total population of the EESs. For Raman scattering, this element implies coherence between the VESs, and no populations of the EESs. Fluoresnce Emission Spectrum of Proteins Using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, you can measure the fluorescence emission spec- trum of a protein, which binds to DNA depending upon the concentration of the small nucleotide cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The protein has a single tryptophan and one tyrosine and forms a dimer at saturating concentrations of cAMP. Please explain the following observations: (a) In the native, ligand-free state (i.e., no cAMP and no DNA), the fluorescence emission has a maximum at 330 nm. (b) When cAMP is bound, the emission maximum shifts to 325 nm. (c) When the protein is folded in 8 M urea, the emission maximum shifts to 350 nm. Suggest one or two experiments to test your explanations. First, let us discuss tryptophan (Trp) and tyrosine (Tyr). Trp is more fluorescence compared to Tyr. Its fluorescence properties are solvent dependent, in that the spectrum will shift to shorter wavelengths, and increase in intensity, as the polarity of the solvent decreases. Tyr is excited at similar wavelengths as Trp, but will emit at different wavelengths. Tyr is also less fluorescent than Trp. At 280 nm, both Trp and Tyr will be excited; to excite Trp only a wavelength of 295 nm is needed. Now, in the native folded state, both Trp and Tyr will be generally located in the core of the protein. In the unfolded state, or partially folded state, Trp and Tyr will become exposed to the solvent. Therefore, we can make the assumption that in the native, ligand-free state the fluorescence emission has an emission peak at 330 nm due to the fact that Trp and Tyr are both in the hydrophobic environment of the protein. In this medium, the relative polarity is low. When Trp and Tyr are moved into a hydrophilic environment due to binding of cAMP, for example, the relative polarity shifts to medium or high. This shift in polarity lowers the emission wavelength. For the situation where the protein is folding in 8 M urea, there will be denaturing of the proteins, such that hydrophobic parts will become exposed. Essentially, the urea will cause the proteins to fold more loosely, which will effect the emission wavelength by increasing it. For experiments, I propose determining the level of polarity of each of the situations, since I made the assumption that the polarity was the main factor affecting the emission maximum. Additionally, I would suggest determining the emission spectrum at different concentrations of cAMP. Fluoresence Correlation Spectroscopy Curves The cAMP-binding protein in the presence of saturating concentrations of cAMP forms a dimer that can bind to a specific site on a 100 base-pair DNA oligo (K d = 2 nM). You decide to study the protein-DNA interaction using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). You can generate a single Cys mutant and label it with Alexa-488- a small fluorophore excited by 488-nm light. Draw and label FCS curves appropriately scaled for the following situations: Diffusion of 5 nM protein dimer (saturating cAMP). 5 nM dimer + cAMP after the addition of 100 nM DNA (100 base-pair oligo with specific dimer site). Diffusion of 1 nM dimer (saturating cAMP). 1 nM dimer + cAMP after the addition of 100 nM DNA (100 base-pair oligo with specific dimer binding site). In fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), changes in the fluorescence in- tensity reflect concentration fluctuations. The auto-correlation of a system evaluates the temporal progression around the system\u2019s equilibrium, and reveals the time required for a molecule to diffuse through a particular volume. The amplitude of the auto-correlation function is influenced by the number of molecules that are detectable. The auto-correlation function can consist of multiple sigmoid components due to multiple signal fluctuations on different time scales. Slow fluctuations of fluorescence intensity demonstrate a slow diffusion over a longer time scale; rapid fluctuations indicate a faster diffusion over a shorter time scale for a particle with a large diffusion coefficient. Essentially, an increase in the diffusion coefficient will correspond to a decrease in the time scale for the auto-correlation function to fall by half. FCS can be used to monitor binding. Because there is more than one species within the solution, we should expect two sigmoid components, one for the free molecules, and one for the bounded molecules. We should also consider that since the amplitude of the auto-correlation function depends on the inverse of the average number of molecules. Thus, we should expect that a FCS curve for the situation with only protein will have a greater amplitude than the situation with dimer and DNA. FCS curves for situations 1 (blue) and 3 (black). Since the amplitude of \\(G(\\tau)\\) depends on \\(1/N\\) , we should expect to see the situation with 1 nM dimer to have the greatest amplitude. FCS curves for situations 2 (blue) and 4 (black). Since there are 3 species present (protein dimer, cAMP, and oligo), we should expect to see three sigmoids. Fret Relationships Assume that a FRET donor D has a single exponential decay in the absence of ac- ceptor A and that the orientation factor is \\(\u03ba_2\\) = 2/3.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) involves a donor molecule in an excited electronic state and an acceptor molecule that can accept the transferred excitation energy from the donor, typically through dipole-dipole coupling. The dipole-dipole coupling can be described as an interaction dependent on the overlap of the emission spectrum of the donor molecule, and the absorption spectrum of the acceptor molecule. This overlap is represented by the figure on the right, and it dictates if there will be an energy transfer between the molecules. The energy transfer efficiency between the two molecules will decrease proportionally to the distance, \\(r\\) , that is seperating them. The rate of energy transfer is: \\[ k_r = \\frac{1}{\\tau_D}\\left(\\frac{R_0}{r} \\right )^6 \\] where \\(\\tau_D\\) is the donar lifetime in the absence of the acceptor, and \\(R_0\\) is the Forster distance. FRET efficiency is: \\[ E_{FRET} = \\left[1 + \\frac{r}{R_0}\\right]^{-6} \\] Now, the relative distances between the donors and acceptors is not uniform; rather, it follows the following distribution function: \\[ E_{FRET} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}{f(r)} \\left[1 + \\frac {r}{R_0}\\right]^{-6} dr \\] where \\(f(r)\\) is the normalized distribution of the donor-acceptor distances.

We will also set \\(x=t/\\tau\\) amd \\(d = R_0/r\\) , such that: \\[ f(x,d) = ~\\text{exp}(-x-xd^6), \\] which can then be ploted for the varying D values. (See also: A. Grinvald, E. Haas, and I. Z.

Generally, both fluorescence and Raman scattering can be explain in two interactions, as shown in the figure on the right.

The figures directly below is a representation of four interactions in the form of ladder diagrams and Feynman diagrams. To help with understanding these diagrams, reference this table: For Raman scattering specifically, we have intensities, \\(\\omega_1, \\omega_2\\) , which are sometimes referred to as the 'pump' and 'probe', respectively. The order of interactions are: \\[ \\omega_1 \\rightarrow \\omega_1^* \\rightarrow \\omega_2 \\rightarrow \\omega_2^* \\] During stimulated Raman emission, these interactions essentially amoun to losing the 'pump' photon and gaining a 'probe' photon. For fluorescence, the order of interaction is: \\[ \\omega_1 \\rightarrow \\omega_2 \\rightarrow \\omega_1^* \\rightarrow \\omega_2^* \\] We know that if the energy of a photon is greater or equal to the differene between the ground state and the excited state (it is resonant with a molecular transition), the molecule can absorb that photon and undergo a transition. In this excited state, the molecule has several options: it may lose some or all of its energy in an interaction with another molecules; it may fall apart if the extra energy is too much, or; it may emit the extra energy as a photon. This last case is known as fluorescence and is the result of that resonant process. Raman scattering, on the other hand, is not a resonant process. Rather, the energy of the photon is not of particular importance. A molecule will recieve EM radiation and re-radiate it This will typically be at the same energy needed for Rayleigh scattergin. Sometimes some of the energy is stored as molecular vibrational energy, and if the molecule is already in an vibrationally excited state, the energy will be emitted as a photon, with the scattered light seeing a shift in the wavelength from its incident EM radiation.

Rotational Diffusion: Intrinsic Viscosity: Sedimentation Sedimentation is a widely used hydrodynamic technique using ultracentrifugation. There are two types of sedimentation experiments (described [here]/types): 1) where the velocity is measured, and 2) where, at equilibrium, the concentration distribution is measured.

There is also a lot of information based on the experimentaton developments that add to this field. These experiments include: dynamic light scattering, nonsecond fluorescence depolarization measurements, fluorescnece correlation spectroscopy, pulsed field gradient NMR, and AUC. But regardless of the technique that are several questions that we can ask about macromolecular structure and function: How many? (value of n for interacting components) How tightly? (binding constants or free energies) Why? (chemical nature of binding site) Where? (physical location of binding site) What of it?

Specifically, we will cover irreversible interactions that can lead to aggregation, and reversible interactions that are driven by mass action. TL;DR Irreversible interactions lead to aggregation which is typically pathologic or unphysiological. Reversible interactions are cause by weak interactions (electrostatic, hydrophobic) and lead to oligomerization . Molecules in solution can display dynamic behaviour in response to external perturbations and changes in their own concentration or environments. In particular, interactions between molecules can lead to covalent bond formation or non-covalent bond formation . Assemblies are formed when molecules interact with other molecules to form higher-order structures. When this interaction is between similiar molecules, it is refered to as self-association . When it is between molecules of different species, it is refered to as hetero-association . Self-Association: \\(A + A \\rightarrow A_{2}\\) . Eg., protein-protien, RNA-RNA, DNA-DNA. Hetero-Association: \\(A + B \\rightarrow AB\\) . Eg., protein-DNA, protein-RNA, DNA-RNA, protein-lipid, protein-carbohydrates, protein-small molecules/drugs/nanoparticles. Which interaction occures depends on the activation energy that needs to be overcome to interconvert between the forward and backward reaction. When the energy barrier becomes too high to go backwards, an interaction reaction is considered to be irreversible. Irreversible Interactions Examples of events that can cause irreversible solution interactions: Oxidation Covalent Cross-Lining (chemically or photo-activated) Hydrophobic, van der Waals interactions, coupled with entropic effects Strucutral changes in the molecules (amyloid beta - beta sheet, insulin fibrils) EXAMPLE Amyloid Beta Aggregation Speransky, V. et al. 2001 J. Cell Biol., 153, 1327 - 1335 Reversible Interactions Reversible interactions typically require structural complementarity and are cause by weak forves and molecular attractions (electrostatic, hydrophobic, salt bridgess, van der Waals forces, and hydrogen bonds). Electrostatic interactions are very important for nucleic acid binding. Dna has a strongly negatively charged backbone (PO_4^-), which can form salt bridges with positively charged amines from lysine sidechains, allowing the stiff, double-stranded DNA to curl around the nucleosome and become flexible. There can be multiple types of reversible reactions that are either self-associations or hetero-associations. The concentration in one component will affect the concentration of the other. Reactions can be fast (diffusion controlled) or slow (kinetically limited), and they observe mass action laws. EXAMPLE Human A. Schiefner et al., Biochem.

AUC Performance Checks In general, the following can be applied to both the XL-A and the Optima AUC. Here, we have listed some general maintenace checks, calibrations, and good practices, as well as tests specific to the absorbance and interference optical systems. General AUC Maintenance Checks and Tests EVERY 3 - 6 MONTHS Radial Alignment Check Rotor Stretch Calibration Counterbalance EVERY EXPERIMENTAL RUN Examine Cell Housings and Centerpieces Ensure Full Non-Leaking Channels To ensure that we are scanning at the right radii, we perform a RADIAL ALIGNMENT CHECK. At 3,000 rpm, perform a radial calibration run to check the radial alighment of the instrument. The ROTOR STRETCH CALIBRATION experiment is the first set of data all UltraScan-III users should acquire for their own rotor and instrument. Titanium rotors used in the Beckman Analytical Ultracentrifuge will stretch as a function of rotor speed, temperature, age and type of centerpieces loaded in them. Since the stretching will translocate the position of each centerpiece and cell, the forces acting on the sedimenting particles will also change as a function of stretching (due to the increased radius, the force increases) and the bottom of the cell, which is a boundary condition of the ASTFEM Lamm equation solution, will also change. To obtain optimal fitting results, it is important that the rotor stretch and centerpiece geometry is properly accounted for in the analysis software. UltraScan-III contains a rotor calibration program that allows you to easily determine your rotor's particular rotor stretching function, and to incorporate this information automatically in the analysis routines in UltraScan. The idea is that you run a calibration experiment where the stretching of the rotor is measured on your instrument, and then these data are fitted to a rotor stretching function, which is then stored in the program and used to provide, in combination with the known centerpiece geometry, the correct boundary conditions for the ASTFEM solutions. More information is found here . Before each run, you must EXAMINE CELL HOUSINGS AND CENTERPEICES. In particular, the Epon centerpeices are not study and can break. When loading, avoid touching the surfaces, or scratching the insides of the channels. Spin Analytical may recondition your centerpeices, if necessary. To ENSURE FULL NON-LEAKING CHANNELS, you will need to check the raw data from the instrument. We want to avoid sample leaking out, as this may lead to deformation of the septum due to differences in hydrostatic pressure. If any leaking is visible (the meniscus peak moving), stop the run immediately. Absorbance Optical System Performance Checklist Xenon Flash Lamp Intenstiy Scan Monochromator Function Lamp Alignment Test Slit Assembly Performance Check Chromatic Abberation Profile Absorbance optics uses a Xenon flash lamp and the intensity of the lamp varies over the spectral range. See image below. Xenon flash lamps are good at emitting visible light down to 190 nm, but above 500 nm, the intensity drops off rather precipiticely. Around 800 nm, the intensity will be a small fraction of what can be seen around 230 nm. If you must measure at higher O.D. values, and you want a lot of singal, measuring at 230 nm may be a good idea. To measure the XENON LAMP EMISSION PROFILE, run an intensity wavelength scan over the dynamic range of the instrument on an empty hole at 6.5 cm. Rotor speed is irrelavent; it is commonly set to 3,000 rpm. You should see a profile similar to the one above, with a peak intensity at 230 nm of at least 15,000 counts. If the intensity is much less than this, clean the lamp, or call for Beckman Services to check the optical system, mirror, PMT, and/or powersupply. If you want to attempt to clean the lamp yourself, and the count is still lower than 15,000 counts, the lamp may need to be aligned. For the XL-A: rotate the lamp in the lamp housing and repeat the intensity scan. Repeat for one full turn, identifying the position that produces the highest intensity. Verify that this is reproducible across every position in the cell. To measure MONOCHROMATOR FUNCTION, run an intensity wavelength scan over the dynamic range on an empty hole at 5.2 cm, 6.5 cm, and 7.1 cm. If the intensity peaks shift, the monochromator may not be working properly. The LAMP ALIGHNMENT TEST allows you to measure the response of the machine as a function of radius. Perform an intensity scan at 280 nm or 230 nm across an empty cell from 5.8 cm to 7.2 cm, Ensure that the intensity plot does not vary by more than 10$, and that the maximum intensity is in the center. The maximum intensity at the center indicates that the optical system is properly aligned. Signal variation of more than 10% can indicate a failing PMT> For SLIT ASSEMBLY PERFORMANCE testing, you will need to scan a cell with some solution (irrelavant) with 280 nm or 230 nm. Check the overlaid menisci of 40-50 scans. They should form a single sharp peak. If the meniscus shifts back and forth, the slit assembly may need to be serviced. The slit assembly is a gold foil with laser-etched slits that provides the radial resolution measured by the PMT. This mechanical assembly in the Proteomlab is driven by a servo motor; the Optima AUC uses a digital stepping motor. The stepping motor is much more radially precise at 10 micron resolution. If there is dirt on the slit assembly, it may cause some stepping. Knowing the CHROMATIC ABBERATION profile of your instrument is especially important for MWL-AUC experiments. Chromatic abberation is a result of each wavelength behaving differently due to the refractive indices of the solution. Once determined, the chromatic abberation profile can be imported into the US-LIMS III database. Interference Optics Performance Checks Radial Alighment and Counterbalance Calibrations Laser Timing Adjustment (XL-A only) It is important to attempt to have a well-balanced contrast between both channels of a cell; this is donw by LASER TIMING ADJUSTMENT. This is not necessarily possible for the user with the Optima AUC, as it would need to be programmed into the machine. You can get a Beckman Service rep to ensure that the voltages are set properly, and that the illumination of the camera is well-balanced.

Many processes can be described using differential equations. When solved, these equations can describe a linear or non-linear model. TL;DR: How to Build Models Modeling involves the description of some observable data using a mathematical equation that describes the underlying physical properties of the experiment. Our process is as such: We need to identify a general, mathematical model that can represent the observed data. The parameters of the model describe the specifics of the data. We need to determine the values of the parameters in the model that best fit our data. This is accomplished by a fitting algorithm that minimizes the differences between the data and the model. Generally, an initial estimate is required that is then improved. We need to estimate the error in the parameters we determined in the fitting process to obtain the confidence intervals EXAMPLE: Radioactive Decay Model Building Hypothesis: The rate of decay is proportional to the number of nuclei present Mathematical Model: \\[ \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial t} = -a N \\] Solve: \\[ N = N_{0} e^{-a(t+t_{s})}+ b \\] MODELS FOR REACTING SYSTEMS: The magnitude of the measureable off-rate depends on the rotor speed and sedimentation coefficient. For faster rotor speeds, higher molecular weight and globular shape will favour the measurement of faster rate constants. Data Fitting Any observable process that influences the measurement needs to be acccounted for in order for models to yeld any meaningful result. The object is then to minimize the residuals between the model and the data. Iverse preoblem: extracting parameters from a simulated solution by fitting the model to experimental data. A non-parametric fit is used to smooth data for display, where the instrinsic model is of little intrest, and hence the parameters are not needed. Method of Least-Squares When useing the Method of Least Squares, we make the following assumptions: The model is a truthful representation of reality. All error is ssociated with a dependent variable. All experimental noise is considered to be of Gaussian distribution. The minimum in the differences occur when the derivative of our objective function with respect to the parameters is zero, so we need to differentiate it with respect to the parameters of interest, a and b. This will lead to a system of linear equations. Any observable process that influences the measurement needs to be accounted for in order for the model to yield meaningful results. Our objective is then to minimize the residuals between the model and the data: \\[ MIN \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{Data_{i} - Model _{i}}{uncertainty_{i}}\\right)^{2} = MIN \\chi^{2}. \\] Extracting parameters from the simulated solution by fitting the model to experimetal data is called an \\(\\bf{\\text{Inverse Problem}}\\) . LEAST-SQUARES EQUATION FOR STRAIGHT LINES: The equation for a straight line is a linear equation: y = mx +b. Remember our least squares equation above; for a straight line, it changes to: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{D_{i} -(a+bx_{i})}{\\sigma_{i}}\\right)^{2} = \\chi^{2}(a,b). \\] The distances from the experimental data and the linear fit are measured to be perpendicular to the data (see figure), and the objective of this method is to find the equation of a straight line that minimizes the distance between the data and the fit. SOLVING THE LEAST SQUARES EQUATION (LINEAR LINE): The minimum in the differences between our data and our fit occurs when the derivative of our function (with respect to the parameters) is zero. Therefore, we must take our least squares equation and differentiate it: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{D_{i} -(\\bf{a} +\\bf{b}x_{i})}{\\sigma_{i}}\\right)^{2} = \\chi^{2}(\\bf{a,b}). \\] With respect to parameter \\(a\\) : \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\chi^{2}(\\bf{a,b}) }{\\partial \\bf{a}} = 0 = -2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( \\frac{D_{i} - \\bf{a} - b x_{i}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}\\right). \\] With respect to parameter \\(b\\) : \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\chi^{2}(\\bf{a,b})}{\\partial \\bf{b}} = 0 = -2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( \\frac{x_{i}(D_{i} - a - \\bf{b} x_{i})}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}\\right). \\] This will lead to a system of linear equations: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\bf{a}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}} + \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{\\bf{b}x_{i}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{D_{i}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}; \\] \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\bf{a}x_{i}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}} + \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{\\bf{b}x_{i}^{2}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{D_{i}x_{i}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}. \\] When in matrix form, this system of equations can be solved by using Cramer's rule, such that: \\[ x_{1} = \\frac{b_{1}a_{22}-b_{2}a_{12}}{a_{11}a_{22}-a_{12}a_{21}}, ~~ x_{2} = \\frac{b_{2}a_{11}-b_{1}a_{21}}{a_{11}a_{22}-a_{12}a_{21}}. \\] Linear Models As discussed above, we know that the equation for a linear equation is \\(y = a + bx\\) , and we know that the equation is linear in the coefficients that are fitted. In fact, the equation doesnt have to be that of a straight line to be considered linear. Rather, we can express it with a polynomial: \\[ y = c_{0} + c_{1}x^{1} + c_{2}x^{2} + ... + c_{n}x^{n}. \\] Then, as long as the coefficients are linear, the equation will be considered a linear fitting equation. It does not matter how wildly non-linear the terms of the independent variable are. For example, our variables can be exponentials, or trignometric functions (all of which are not linear): \\[ y = c_{0} + (x-\\sin(x^{3})c_{1} + \\exp^{-(4-3x)}c_{2} + \\ln(3x^{4})c_{3} + ... + c_{n}X_{n}, \\] with \\(X_{n}\\) being any non-linear term. That being said, sometimes we may want to constrain the value of a paramater. For example, suppose we do not want the amplitude of an exponential term to turn negative during the fitting process. We can prevent this by fitting the log of a number, such that the fitted value will never be negative. \\[ y = \\bf{a} e^{bx} + c \\rightarrow e^{\\ln(\\bf{a}) + bx} + c; ~~ e^{ln(a)} = a. \\] EXAMPLE: Linearization Linearization of a Non-Linear Equation Suppose we have an exponential equation of the form: \\[ y = c_{1}e^{c_{2}x}. \\] To linearize it, we take the natural logarithm on both side. \\[ \\ln(y) = \\ln(c_{1}\\cdot e^{c_{2}x}) = \\ln(c_{1}) + c_{2}x. \\] Non-Linear Regression What is the importance of an equation being linear or non-linear? It turns out that non-linear functions require fitting using iterative approaches, while linear functions can be fitted using a single interation. Consider the Jacobian matrix for non-linear systems: \\[ \\bf{J} = \\frac{d \\bf{f}}{d \\bf{x}} = \\frac{\\partial \\bf{f}}{\\partial x_{1}} \\cdots \\frac{\\partial \\bf{f}}{\\partial x_{n}}= \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_1} & \\cdots & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_n} \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_m}{\\partial x_1} & \\cdots & \\frac{\\partial f_m}{\\partial x_n} \\end{bmatrix} \\] We are hoping to iteratively improve the parameter estimates by following along the gradient of the error functino in the direction of maximum imporovement. This requires knowledge of the partial derivatives of each parameters at each point in the experiment. Let us therefore take: \\[ \\bf{J} (a-g) = \\Delta y, \\] where \\(\\bf{J}\\) is the Jacobian matrix, shown above, \\(g\\) is the current parameter estimate, \\(a\\) is the adjustment made to the parameter estimate in the current iternation, and \\(\\Delta y\\) is the difference between the experimental data and the model. To solve for the value of \\(a\\) : \\bf{J}^{T}J (a-g) = \\bf{J}^{T}\\Delta y. Once here, we have two options. Option 1: \\[ (\\bf{J}^{T}\\bf{J}^{-1})\\bf{J}^{T}(a-g) = (\\bf{J}^{T}\\bf{J})^{-1}\\bf{J}^{T} \\Delta y. \\] Option 2 is when \\(\\bf{J}^{T}\\bf{J}\\) is positive, so that we can use the Cholesky decomposition ( \\(\\bf{J}^{T}\\bf{J} = \\bf{LL}^{T}\\) ). We then iterate until the function converges. EXAMPLE: Appropriateness of Fitting Approaches For each of the following situations, what is the fitting approach. Is it non-parametric, gradient descent, grid method, or stochastic? Is it linear or non-linear in its fitting parameters? If the appraoch is non-parametric, propose a function for it. A. Smoothing a set of noisy data with a recognizable wave pattern B. Fitting parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from function: \\[ F(x) = a_{0} + a_{1}\\log(ax) + a_{2}\\sin(b-x^{2}) + c \\] C. Fitting paramaters \\(a_{i}\\) from function: \\[ F(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{100}a_{i}e^{b_{i}(x^{2}-c^{2})},~~\\text{where}~ b_{i} = \\frac{1}{100}. \\] D.

Each time, a slightly different value is obtained for the experimental observation. If we assume a Gaussian distribution of errors in the measurement, we can determine the standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\) , of the distribution of measured parametes. Then we can use \\(\\sigma\\) to set the error bars on the measurement and to scale the contribution of a datapoint to the sum of residuals. To calculate the standard deviataion, use the following equation: \\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \\bar x)^{2}}, \\] where \\(\\bar x\\) is the average of all measurements. ERROR SURFACES: Each parameter combination a, b results in a unique error when fitted to the experimental data. The optimal solution occurs where the error is the smallest. Ideally, the error surface is continuously differentiable. GOODNESS OF FIT: The quality of the fit is determined by the randomness of the residuals, and the root mean square deviatio (RMSD). The randomness of the residuals can be measured by determining the runs. Runs (R) are the number of consecutive positive (p) or negative (n) residuals from the mean. \\[ R_{T} = \\frac{R-\\bar R}{\\sigma_{R}} \\] where \\(R_{T}\\) is the measure of randomness, and: \\[ \\bar R = \\frac{2np}{n + p} + 1 \\] \\[ \\sigma_{R}^{2} = \\frac{2np(2np-n-p)}{n+p)^{2}(n+p-1)}. \\] Optimization Methods For linear fits, our options for optimizing methods include straight line fits, generalized inear least squares, non-negative constrained least squares, multi-dimensional spectrum analyses, and non-parametric fits. Examples of non-parametric fits are B-splines and polynomial smoothing. For non-linear optimizatin using gradient descent methods for functions of type, \\(y = F(a_{i},x_{i})\\) , we can use Levenberg-Marquardt, Gauss-Newton, Quasi-Netwon, conjugate gradients, tangent approximation, or neural networks. A problem with non-linear least squares optimization is that for multi-component systems, the algorithm gets easily stuck in local minima and the solution will depend on the starting points. This problem gets worse when there are more parameters.

TL;DR: How to Build Models Modeling involves the description of some observable data using a mathematical equation that describes the underlying physical properties of the experiment. Our process is as such: We need to identify a general, mathematical model that can represent the observed data. The parameters of the model describe the specifics of the data. We need to determine the values of the parameters in the model that best fit our data. This is accomplished by a fitting algorithm that minimizes the differences between the data and the model.

All error is ssociated with a dependent variable. All experimental noise is considered to be of Gaussian distribution.

Recall the section on speed in the page on the experimental technique of sedimentation veloctity. When observing the properties of a single molecule, judicious selection of one rotor speed optimizes the avaliale information, but accurary and precision is sacrified when one is limited to only selecting one speed for heterogenous mixtures. Heterogeneous mixtures present complications making it that no single speed will be optimal for all species. Single speeds can also prevent the investigator from asking specific questions together. For example: If molar mass or anisotropy needs to be determine, you will need to have a slow speed to generate sufficient diffusion information. However this sacrifices composition details. If composition detail is required, you need a higher speed, but balancing the signals from diffusion and sedimentation using only one speed is challanging. There is no guide to consult and the composition is not known before hand to help with picking the optimal speed. Therefore, the ability to perform an experiment at multiple speeds provides additional detail and resolution for mixtures of particles that are heterogenous in sedimentation coefficients. The main idea behind multi-speed SV experiments is this: for mixtures containin solutes that exhibit range in sedimentation and diffusion coefficients, experiments with speed profiles incorporating multiple speeds will better match the properites of each solute. Experimental Design Now, we will describe: how to design a suitable speed profile for a heterogeneous mixture, and; how a suitable finite-element analysis method can exploit the sedimentation and diffusion signal avaliable from multiple speed steps. For heterogeneous systems, each component will have a different sedimentation coefficient, and so the duration will be diferent for each species. As described previously , the equation to determine the theoretical duration of an experiment is: \\[ t = \\ln \\left( \\frac{r_{b}}{r_{m}}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}s} \\] where \\(r_{m}\\) is the meniscus position and \\(r_{b}\\) is the bottom position of the cell (considered to be infinitely long). The optimal time, \\(t\\) , is no less than the duration required for the midpoint of the boundary from each component with sedimentation coefficient, \\(s\\) , to sediment from the meniscus position to the point where it would reach the bottom of the cell. Knowning this, the first speed step should start with the lowest speed which will have a low enough speed, \\(v_{1}\\) , and large enough duration, \\(t_{1}\\) , to provide sufficient diffusion signal and scanning time. This speed will optimally describe the largest species in the system. The second speed step, \\(v_{2}\\) , is for measuring the second largest species. For predicting \\(t_{2}\\) , consider the sedimentation displacement for species 2 during the first speed step and subtract that amount from the sedimenation still required from the boundary midpoint from species 2 to reach the bottom. Subsequent speed steps, \\(v_{n}\\) , follow the same principle with each species aquiring a new meniscus from each speed step. The change in speed for each step depends on the \\(s\\) value distribution. This value can be approximated from a single-speed experiment if it is not known. Here is a program (pdf , C++ file ) that takes the original meniscus, the largest \\(s\\) value, and the starting and maximal rotor speed to predit the apropriate rotor speeds and speed step durations for optimal speed step configurations. Overall, variable speed profiles allow the investigator to obtain much higher precision and accurary for heterogeneous samples. This is exceptionally demonstrated in the example below. Example: Experimental Design for 5-Component Simulation Model To establish the value of multi-speed SV measurents, consider the following example where a mixture of five discrete components at identical concentrations are simulated.

European Biophysics Journal , 47 (7), 815-823. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00249-018-1308-0 Fitting Approaches Fitting SV experimental data acquired at multiple speeds pose a series of challenges when fitting the data. These challenges are rotor stretch, shifting radial positions at different speeds, and the lack of acceleration profiles and time-state information. Solutions for these issues have been resolved and implemented in UltraScan. UltraScan separates each speed step into seperate experimental datasets when collecting multi-speed data. Initially, each speed step must be analyzed as a separate experiment. The first step in the analysis procedure is to identify the maximum \\(s\\) value. The slowest speed step contains the signal from the fastest sedimenting solutes and should therefore be used to determine the upper limit of all speed steps. To eliminate time-invariant noise by scan pair subtraction, it is best to use the time-derivative method 1 that is implemented in UltraScan. To estimate the upper limit, select a group of scans near the end of the first speed step. The point where the \\(g^{*}(s)\\) distribution approaches zero on the high end of the sedimentation coefficient spectrum should represent the upper limit. For the lowest \\(s\\) value, it is usually appropriate to set it to 0.5 s, unless otherwise known to be higher. Frictional ratio ranges can also be chosen based on prior knowlege of the system's species. The data analysis on UltraScan is performed on parallel architectures. 2 The steps are the same as those outlined in the Sedimentation Velocity Analysis Flowchart . Remember that each speed step should be treated initially as a separate analysis, allowing for the use of a different 2DSA grid for each speed step. Furthermore, each speed step requires simulation of all the prior speed steps becuase the acceleration history needs to be preserved to obtain the appropriate initial concentration distribution for each modelled solute at the beginning of each speed step.

Recall the section on speed in the page on the experimental technique of sedimentation veloctity. When observing the properties of a single molecule, judicious selection of one rotor speed optimizes the avaliale information, but accurary and precision is sacrified when one is limited to only selecting one speed for heterogenous mixtures. Heterogeneous mixtures present complications making it that no single speed will be optimal for all species. Single speeds can also prevent the investigator from asking specific questions together. For example: If molar mass or anisotropy needs to be determine, you will need to have a slow speed to generate sufficient diffusion information. However this sacrifices composition details. If composition detail is required, you need a higher speed, but balancing the signals from diffusion and sedimentation using only one speed is challanging. There is no guide to consult and the composition is not known before hand to help with picking the optimal speed. Therefore, the ability to perform an experiment at multiple speeds provides additional detail and resolution for mixtures of particles that are heterogenous in sedimentation coefficients. The main idea behind multi-speed SV experiments is this: for mixtures containin solutes that exhibit range in sedimentation and diffusion coefficients, experiments with speed profiles incorporating multiple speeds will better match the properites of each solute.","title":"Multi-Speed Sedimentation Velocity"},{"location":"multispeed-sedveloc/#experimental-design","text":"Now, we will describe: how to design a suitable speed profile for a heterogeneous mixture, and; how a suitable finite-element analysis method can exploit the sedimentation and diffusion signal avaliable from multiple speed steps.

As described previously , the equation to determine the theoretical duration of an experiment is: \\[ t = \\ln \\left( \\frac{r_{b}}{r_{m}}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}s} \\] where \\(r_{m}\\) is the meniscus position and \\(r_{b}\\) is the bottom position of the cell (considered to be infinitely long).

Fitting Noise Lorem Ipsum SedFit uses an algebraic noise decomposition strategy based on direct least-squares modelling. There is no increase in the statistical noise, and you can obtain explicit estimates for the magnitude of the systematic noise components. However, there are two limitations to keep in mind when using this method of systematic noise decomposition: Calculated systematic noise is an estimate and model dependent. we can only assume the calculated noise to reflect a true baseline signal if we have a good fit for our sedimentation data. There is no fundamental difference in the effect of systematic noise on the data analysis from a time-difference analysis. Fortunately, for larger data sets, the baseline is usually well-determined, and so the issues described above are not largely problematic. TI Noise in TI Signals Work on this matter is being done by Saeed Mortezazadeh, post-doctoral fellow at the University of Lethbridge. When performing equilibirum experiments, it is not possible to distinguish the time-invarient noise patterns from the signals due to the balancing of the sediment flux with the diffusion flux (Fick's Laws). Solution 1: run empty cells and collect the intensity data patterns of each radial point and wavelength. The volume of the data collected must be significant (due to the presence of statistical noise in each scan) so that a time-invariant pattern can be averaged over all scans. It is important to note that while the AUC Optima claims to emit light with a one nanometer resolution over a 190 nm to 700 nm range, different patterns can be observed in both the shape and intensity of scans. This is especially prevelant at lower wavelengths and it seems that the monochromatic optical system does not completely split the light, and as a result, the light emitted at a particular wavlength can be paritally mixed with neighbouring wavelengths. The intensity of each scan is calculated by averaging the intensity of all radial points: \\[ \\hat I = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum^{N}_{i=1} I (R_{i}). \\] The root mean square deviation (RMSD) is calculated to qantify the shape of each scan: \\[ \\text{RMSD} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum^{N}_{i=1}(I(R_{i}) - \\hat I)^{2}}. \\] The mean and RMSD overlapp of scans are clearly visible between neighbouring wavelengths. How do we detemine which scan belongs to which wavelength? Calculate the histogram (probability distribution function) of the RMSD values for each wavelength using the core density equilibirium method. Scans with similar scans are consider to be in a cluster; histograms are used to cluster scans of all wavelengths. The main scans of corresponding scans are assumed to be the scans belonging to the cluster with the highest probability distribution. If the non-original clusters overlap with the main cluster of adjacent wavelengths, the corresponding scans are transferred to the adjacent wavelength.

These improvements are needed for the next generation of AUC-based research. The Open AUC Project combines on-going work from several different groups. The openAUC project encompasses both hardware and software developments. All software will use the GNU Public License to assure that intellectual property is available in open source format. As new instruments and software are being developed, their design offers an open architecture, hardware standards, and application programming interfaces for detector developers. The openAUC strategy facilitates collaborations, encourages sharing, and eliminates the chronic impediments that have plagued AUC innovation for the last 20 year. It was found that if the Beckman AUC can be used for future AUC developments, it would need to: Have an open source communication protocol; Provide mounts for light sources and detectors outside the vacumn chamber, and provide windows for all optical paths; Offer multiple optical paths, and support simulataneous data aquisition by different optical systems; 4 Support a standard docking mechanisim; Offer specialized hardware and the software drivers needed to synchronize data acquisition.","title":"openAUC"},{"location":"openAUC/#multi-wavelength-detector-for-the-beckman-optima-xl","text":"This instrument is developed in Germany by Helmut Coelfen at the University of Konstanz with support from BASF (Wendel Wohlleben).

Concentration Measurements When designing AUC experiments for UV optics it is highly recommended to measure in intensity rather than absorbance mode. In intensity experiments one needs to make very accurate concentration measurements to avoid accidental gain set changes in the Beckman XL-A instruments. The reference channel should be filled with a 0.3 OD solution, and a 0.9 OD solution in the sample channel (both channels as determined in a 1.0 cm pathlength cuvette). In the XLA, typically a 1.2 cm pathlength centerpiece is used, which then increases absorbance to 0.36 and 1.08 OD respectively. Those levels are within the limits of linear detection on a well functioning XLA spectrophotometer at most wavelengths accessible with this instrument. However, if the OD level in the reference channel is exceeded, gain set adjustments are likely to occur over the course of the experiment, leading to problematic data. This requires stopping the run, diluting the sample to an appropriate level, and restarting the run. Designing Fluorescence Binding Titration Experiments When you perform a binding experiment in fluorescence mode, the object is to follow the labeled component and measure the concentration of the free and complexed fluorescently labeled component. Of course, in a fluorescence experiment you cannot see the unlabeled component, and this makes interpretation a lot easier. The unlabeled component only becomes visible indirectly, when the labeled component is complexed with it.

Beckman AUC Rotor Types The only rotors that can be used with the Optima AUC and the ProteomeLab XL-A/I are the An-60 Ti, and An-5- Ti rotors.

All eight holes are parallel to the axis of rotation. RCF = relative centrifugal field. RCF is the ratio of the centrifugal acceleration of a specified radius and speed to the standard acceleration of gravity. It is represented by equation where r is the radius (mm), w is the angular velocity (radians per second), and g is the standard acceleration of gravity (9807 mm/s2). In both rotors, the cell holes are numbered for easy identification, and have a handle attached for easy lifting. Rotors should always be placed on their stands when not in the ultracentrifuge to prevent damage to the overspeed disk. For overspeed protection, a photoelectric detector in the XL-A/XL-I analytical ultracentri- fuge monitors the overspeed disk on the bottom of the rotor and shuts down the run if speeds exceeding the rotor\u2019s rated maximum are detected. In addition, magnets have been inserted in the overspeed disk between cell holes 1 and 4 (An-60 Ti) or 1 and 8 (An-50 Ti). A sensor in the rotor chamber, triggered by these magnets, is used for timing the light sources. Special care should be taken to avoid damaging this dual-purpose disk; always set the rotor down carefully on the rotor stand or drive spindle. Rotor Safety The forces generated in high-speed ultracentrifuges like the Optima AUC are enormous. For example, if 1 gram of a material was placed on the botto of a rotor bucket rotating at 60,000 rpm, we would find it would exert the gravitational equibalent of 0.5 ton of centrifugal mass at the bottom of the bucket. We must also take into account that the strucutral failure characteristic that make metal rotors dangerous is their propensity to catastrophically fail. That is, having a significiant mass removed from the main body while at speed. This is what that looks like: -The seperated piece is thrown into the sidde of the centrifuge at extremely high speeds. -The centrifuge will immediately go into a violent state of imbalance. Hopefully, it will shut off before more damage occurs. -The main body of the rotor may strike the side wall of the centrifuge. -Less concerning, but the cells containing your sample will be broken, and liquid exposed. This is illustrated here by PennEHRS. After all, rotor safety while in the rotor chamber is linked to rotor balance. The mass of the rotor must be evenly distrubted on the drive hub, allowing the rotor to turn smoothly. An improperly loaded rotor will be unbalanced and consistent running of unbalanced rotors will cause the drive life to diminish. To balance a rotor, fill all opposing tubes to the same level with liquid of the same density, and check the mass of each cell. Opposite cells must be within 0.5 o g of each other. Life, Maintenance, and Retirement Proper Care and Handling of a AUC Rotor includes: Recording of the purchase data, manufacturing data, and serial number. Reading of the manuals before use, and following all operational specificiations that the manufactuer recommends. Not exceeding the maximum speed and sample density ratings. Speed reductions are required for running high-density solutions. Keeping a well-kept rotor log that includes date, user, rotor used, and any problems encountered. Storing the rotors in a dry environment, not in the centrifuge. Regular cleaning/decontamination/sterilization The rotor body can be autoclaved at 121-degrees Celsius for up to an hour, if necessary. Frequent Inspections Periodly inspect the rotor, particularly inside cavities, while looking for any rough spots, cracks, pitting, or heavy discoloration. If any of these are evident, do not use that rotor. Inspect the overspeed disk. If scratched, damaged, or missing, do not use rotor until it is replaced.

European Biophysics Journal , 49 (8). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00249-020-01434-z Calibration Results Using the calibration disk, described here , highly accurate and reproducible rotor stretching profiles for Beckman's AN50Ti and AN60Ti rotors were obtained (see Table 1).

The protocol (for both the Optima AUC and the Proteomelab instrument) is as follows. Using the manufacturere's counterbalance in hole 4 or hole 8 (dependent on rotor type), the Optima AUC was radially calibratied, using the manufactuer's programmed method. This method calibrates at 3,000 rpm and 250 nm. The calibration disk, described above, is sandwiched between two windows and their window holders in the standard cell housing, fitted with two spaces (8.5 mm space above the upper windown, 3 mm space below the lower window). The opposite hole can be filled with either a counterbalance or filled cell of equal weight to balance the rotor. The rotor is accelerated to 60,000 rpm for 10 mins to allow for all cell components to enter their equilibirum positions within the cell housing. The rotor is brought down to rest, and temperature equilibrated for at least 2 hours under vacuum to remove any stretch hysteresis. Calibration data is collected with a run profile that accelerates to 3,000 rpm, and after a 15-min delay, scans the calibration disk at least 5 times. The rotor is then accelerated by 1,000 rpm to 4,000 rpm, and a second round of data collection is performed, after another 15 minute delay. This is repeated, with increments of 1,000 rpm for each step, until the maximum speed is reached. For the An-60, that is 60,000 rpm; for the An-50, it is 50,000 rpm. \\(\\textbf{Figure 1}\\) Intensity rotor stretch data collected from a calibration disk from an An-60 rotor, 0-60,000 rpm in 1,000 rpm steps.

Analysis of Profiles The analysis procedure is in pdf form here . \\(\\textbf{Figure 2}\\) Rotor stretching data for an AN60Ti rotor between 10,000 RPM and 60,000 RPM (blue), fitted to a second order polynomial (red). The black crosses represent the standard deviation. The rotor calibration experiment is the first set of data all UltraScan-III users should acquire for their own rotor and instrument. Titanium rotors used in the Beckman Analytical Ultracentrifuge will stretch as a function of rotor speed, temperature, age and type of centerpieces loaded in them. UltraScan-III contains a rotor calibration program that allows you to easily determine your rotor's particular rotor stretching function, and to incorporate this information automatically in the analysis routines in UltraScan. The idea is that you run a calibration experiment where the stretching of the rotor is measured on your instrument, and then these data are fitted to a rotor stretching function, which is then stored in the program and used to provide, in combination with the known centerpiece geometry, the correct boundary conditions for the ASTFEM solutions. Step 1: Measurement of the calibration data To measure the calibration data, select the centerpieces and rotor to be calibrated and make sure that the centerpieces and counterbalance are properly balanced. An imbalance in the rotor may cause tilting, and deteriorate the sharpness of the centerpiece corners since they are no longer vertical. It is recommended to leave the centerpieces empty. Use fully assembled cells in the 4 hole rotor and 7 in the 8 hole rotor, and insert the counterbalance. Program a methods scan in the Beckman data acquisition software with the following settings: Radial mode, 0.001 cm resolution, continuous mode Limits: 5.7 cm to 7.3 cm Scan all cells, including the counterbalance Acquire intensity data, not absorbance or interference data. Set the monochromator to 230 nm Starting with 3000 rpm, perform duplicate or triplicate scans at 1000 rpm increments up to 50,000 (AN50Ti) or 60,000 rpm (AN60Ti) Wait for 5 minutes at each speed before scanning to make sure the rotor stretch is equilibrated Note for Proteomelab users: Use the Equilibrium Method Panel in the Beckman data acquisition program to program all speeds to make sure all speed scans are recorded in the same directory. Step 2: Convert Legacy Data Import the data into UltraScan-III with the \"Convert Legacy Data\" function in the \"Utilities\" menu. \\Make sure to classify the data as a \"Calibration\" experiment, not a velocity or equilibrium experiment! Create a new rotor with the rotor utility under \"Edit Run Information\", \"Select Lab/Rotor/Calibration\" with the \"Add new Rotor\" function. Select a default dummy rotor calibration, since you don't have a valid calibration yet. The dummy calibration is based on the calibration of one of our rotors, and is probably fairly typical for all Beckman rotors, but it is worth it to get your own calibration to make sure the data are optimal. Later on, you will be able to replace the dummy calibration with your own calibration so it can be picked by default. Proceed with the legacy data conversion as described in the UltraScan-III Manual. Step 3: Calculate the rotor calibration Load the data into the UltraScan-III Rotor calibration\" program in the \"Utilities\" menu. The program will show alternating views of the intensity profiles for top and bottom, and channel A and channel B. So, each cell will provide four sets of calibration data for the rotor stretch. These data also are used to calculate average dimensions for the cells and the center position at rest. This position should be at 6.500 cm. A consistent deviation of this number could reflect an incorrect radial calibration file for your instrument. The top of each channel is shown in red, and the bottom of each channel is shown in green. Using the mouse, draw a rectangle around the most vertical section of each plot as shown in this figure. Repeat until all cells and the counterbalance have been processed. When the last counterbalance corner has been defined, a calibration profile will appear on the screen and the calibration information can be viewed. In this example , the center position for cells 1-3 all show a consistent drift to the right, with about 0.02 cm offset from center. There are three possible reasons for this: the cell housings are worn out and the centerpiece is not correctly positioned in the center of the rotor hole; the rotor calibration file has inaccurate calibration information, or; the cell has not been properly aligned and the centerpiece is not correctly positioned in the rotor hole. When the bottom positions are significantly different for each channel of a cell, the cell may be misaligned in the rotor, When the bottom position at rest does not agree with the measured values for each centerpiece, then the calibration file is most likely inaccurate, or the cell housing is worn out. Step 4: Associate the rotor calibration with the right rotor Once you are satisfied with the rotor calibration profile you can associate it with your rotor in the Rotor Calibration program of UltraScan-III.

Predicted values for the An50Ti rotor suggest that these rotors will stretch more than the An60Ti rotors by an average of 4.3%. The amount of maximum stretch was not correlated to the age of the rotor. \\(\\textbf{Table 1}\\) Rotor stretch calibration resutls for the five rotors in use at the Canadian Center for Hydrodynamics at the University of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. \\[\\begin{array}{llcll} \\hline \\text{Rotor} & \\text{Type} & \\text{Temperature (}^{o}\\text{C)} & \\text{50 kRPM Stretch (cm)} & \\text{60 kRPM Stretch (cm)} \\\\ \\hline 17u900 & \\text{AN}50 & 20 & & \\\\ 97u378 & \\text{AN}50 & 20 & & \\\\ 00u569 & \\text{AN}50 & 20 & & \\\\ \\hline 18u919 & \\text{AN}60 & 20 & & \\\\ \\hline 92u341\\text{-a} & \\text{AN}60 & 20 & & \\\\ 92u341\\text{-b} & \\text{AN}60 & 20 & & \\\\ 92u341 & \\text{AN}60 & 4 & & \\\\ 92u341 & \\text{AN}60 & 37 & & \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\\] Collection of Rotor Stretch Profiles Here is a method to measure the titanium rotor stretch of the 4-hole An-60 and the 8-hole An-50 rotors as a function of speed to predict the precise movement of the radial reference frame during rotor acceleration. The protocol (for both the Optima AUC and the Proteomelab instrument) is as follows. Using the manufacturere's counterbalance in hole 4 or hole 8 (dependent on rotor type), the Optima AUC was radially calibratied, using the manufactuer's programmed method. This method calibrates at 3,000 rpm and 250 nm. The calibration disk, described above, is sandwiched between two windows and their window holders in the standard cell housing, fitted with two spaces (8.5 mm space above the upper windown, 3 mm space below the lower window). The opposite hole can be filled with either a counterbalance or filled cell of equal weight to balance the rotor. The rotor is accelerated to 60,000 rpm for 10 mins to allow for all cell components to enter their equilibirum positions within the cell housing. The rotor is brought down to rest, and temperature equilibrated for at least 2 hours under vacuum to remove any stretch hysteresis. Calibration data is collected with a run profile that accelerates to 3,000 rpm, and after a 15-min delay, scans the calibration disk at least 5 times. The rotor is then accelerated by 1,000 rpm to 4,000 rpm, and a second round of data collection is performed, after another 15 minute delay. This is repeated, with increments of 1,000 rpm for each step, until the maximum speed is reached. For the An-60, that is 60,000 rpm; for the An-50, it is 50,000 rpm. \\(\\textbf{Figure 1}\\) Intensity rotor stretch data collected from a calibration disk from an An-60 rotor, 0-60,000 rpm in 1,000 rpm steps.

Analysis of Profiles The analysis procedure is in pdf form here . \\(\\textbf{Figure 2}\\) Rotor stretching data for an AN60Ti rotor between 10,000 RPM and 60,000 RPM (blue), fitted to a second order polynomial (red). The black crosses represent the standard deviation. The rotor calibration experiment is the first set of data all UltraScan-III users should acquire for their own rotor and instrument. Titanium rotors used in the Beckman Analytical Ultracentrifuge will stretch as a function of rotor speed, temperature, age and type of centerpieces loaded in them. UltraScan-III contains a rotor calibration program that allows you to easily determine your rotor's particular rotor stretching function, and to incorporate this information automatically in the analysis routines in UltraScan. The idea is that you run a calibration experiment where the stretching of the rotor is measured on your instrument, and then these data are fitted to a rotor stretching function, which is then stored in the program and used to provide, in combination with the known centerpiece geometry, the correct boundary conditions for the ASTFEM solutions. Step 1: Measurement of the calibration data To measure the calibration data, select the centerpieces and rotor to be calibrated and make sure that the centerpieces and counterbalance are properly balanced. An imbalance in the rotor may cause tilting, and deteriorate the sharpness of the centerpiece corners since they are no longer vertical. It is recommended to leave the centerpieces empty. Use fully assembled cells in the 4 hole rotor and 7 in the 8 hole rotor, and insert the counterbalance. Program a methods scan in the Beckman data acquisition software with the following settings: Radial mode, 0.001 cm resolution, continuous mode Limits: 5.7 cm to 7.3 cm Scan all cells, including the counterbalance Acquire intensity data, not absorbance or interference data. Set the monochromator to 230 nm Starting with 3000 rpm, perform duplicate or triplicate scans at 1000 rpm increments up to 50,000 (AN50Ti) or 60,000 rpm (AN60Ti) Wait for 5 minutes at each speed before scanning to make sure the rotor stretch is equilibrated Note for Proteomelab users: Use the Equilibrium Method Panel in the Beckman data acquisition program to program all speeds to make sure all speed scans are recorded in the same directory. Step 2: Convert Legacy Data Import the data into UltraScan-III with the \"Convert Legacy Data\" function in the \"Utilities\" menu. \\Make sure to classify the data as a \"Calibration\" experiment, not a velocity or equilibrium experiment! Create a new rotor with the rotor utility under \"Edit Run Information\", \"Select Lab/Rotor/Calibration\" with the \"Add new Rotor\" function. Select a default dummy rotor calibration, since you don't have a valid calibration yet. The dummy calibration is based on the calibration of one of our rotors, and is probably fairly typical for all Beckman rotors, but it is worth it to get your own calibration to make sure the data are optimal. Later on, you will be able to replace the dummy calibration with your own calibration so it can be picked by default. Proceed with the legacy data conversion as described in the UltraScan-III Manual. Step 3: Calculate the rotor calibration Load the data into the UltraScan-III Rotor calibration\" program in the \"Utilities\" menu. The program will show alternating views of the intensity profiles for top and bottom, and channel A and channel B. So, each cell will provide four sets of calibration data for the rotor stretch. These data also are used to calculate average dimensions for the cells and the center position at rest. This position should be at 6.500 cm. A consistent deviation of this number could reflect an incorrect radial calibration file for your instrument. The top of each channel is shown in red, and the bottom of each channel is shown in green. Using the mouse, draw a rectangle around the most vertical section of each plot as shown in this figure. Repeat until all cells and the counterbalance have been processed. When the last counterbalance corner has been defined, a calibration profile will appear on the screen and the calibration information can be viewed. In this example , the center position for cells 1-3 all show a consistent drift to the right, with about 0.02 cm offset from center. There are three possible reasons for this: the cell housings are worn out and the centerpiece is not correctly positioned in the center of the rotor hole; the rotor calibration file has inaccurate calibration information, or; the cell has not been properly aligned and the centerpiece is not correctly positioned in the rotor hole. When the bottom positions are significantly different for each channel of a cell, the cell may be misaligned in the rotor, When the bottom position at rest does not agree with the measured values for each centerpiece, then the calibration file is most likely inaccurate, or the cell housing is worn out. Step 4: Associate the rotor calibration with the right rotor Once you are satisfied with the rotor calibration profile you can associate it with your rotor in the Rotor Calibration program of UltraScan-III.

European Biophysics Journal , 47 (7), 815-823. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00249-018-1308-0 What is the optimal speed for a given solution? The rotor's speed is a function of the mass of the particle, its diffusion characteristics, time between scans, and sample heterogeneity, but there is no simple relationship between them. It is important to consider the singal produced by the sedimenting particle for each of the fitted parameters (sedimentation coefficient, diffusion coefficient, etc.). The larger the signal of a parameter, the higher the confidence in the determination of the parameter. There is an inverse relationship between the sedimentation and diffusion transport signals as a function of the rotor speed and experiment duration. Consider the case where the rotor speed is increased: the seperation will increase; resolution is \\(s\\) is improved. But, a fast sedimenting particle will reduce the information avaliable for the diffusion coefficient because it does not spend much time diffusing before it is pelleted. Now, consider the case where the rotor speed is decreased: lower resolution in \\(s\\) ; more signal in \\(D\\) . Another factor to consider is the number of scans that can be collected during the duration of the experiment. There is a practical limit on the time avaliable for scanning based on the nmber of samples in the rotor. Futhermore, the transport by diffusion is proportional to the square root power of time, while transport due to sedimentation proceeds with the first power of time. Identification of Optimal Speed Profiles for Homogeneous and Heterogenous Samples Using Simulated Data For reliable test cases we can use simulated data, which permits a systematic evaluation of the information that is retrieved under conditions where rotor speed and experimental duration are varied, with all other paramaters held constant. It is crucial to have a properly designed experiment to recover information from a SV experiment. The following factors contribute to the informations quality: \\(\\textbf{COLUMN LENGTH}\\) Longer columns allow for more data points with improved seperation. However, diffusion transport is maximized near the top of the cell, where the steep concentration gradients near the meniscus enhances diffusional flows. The diffusion has a similar effect at the bottom of the cell, where the concentration gradeients enhance diffusion information from the back-diffusional flow off the cell bottom. Despite the high concentration regions at the bottom tending to be outside most detector's dynamic range, the curvatureof the boundary is still significiantly affected in the regions where measurements are possible. \\(\\textbf{DURATION}\\) The experiment should be long enough to allow the solute to completely sediment. Lower information will be avaiable if the experiment is aborted too early, and collecting data past the pelleting or equilibiurm state is pointless as there will be no new information. \\(\\textbf{SIGNAL CONCENTRATION AND DURATION}\\) The amount of single avaliable should be scaled to the noise that is expected from the experiment. The Beckman Proteomelab XL-A has a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 250-300, and the Beckman Optima AUC is at least two-fold higher. The SNR is calculated by dividing the total signal by the RMSD of the fitted data when random residuals are obtained. Simulation Parameters for Experimental Datasets Maximum column length: 1.3 cm Mensiscus: 5.9 cm (1 mm air bubble above) Bottom of Cell: 7.2 cm Total Loading Volume: 0.45 ml The duration of the experiment for a given speed and solute is derived from: \\[ s = \\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}r}\\frac{\\text{d}r}{\\text{d}t}, \\] which is the definition of the sedimetation coefficient divided by the centrifugal field strength. This leads to the differential equation: \\[ \\int_{r_{m}}^{r_{b}} \\frac{\\text{d}r}{r} = \\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\\omega^{2}~\\text{d}t, \\] where \\(r_{m}\\) is the meniscus position, \\(t_{0}\\) is the starting time, and \\(r_{b}\\) is the midpoint of the boundary at some time \\(t\\) . When this equation is solved or \\(t\\) , with \\(t_{0}\\) = 0, we obtain an equation to predit the optimal duratio nof a SV experiment at any speed: \\[ t = \\ln \\left( \\frac{r_{b}}{r_{m}}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}s}. \\] This equation is embedded in a calculator in UltraScan that will estimate the optimal time for a given rotor speed and \\(s\\) value, and the optimal speed for a given experimental duration, given \\(s\\) .

This is represented by the shallower traces (in red) and the increased back-diffusion affect on the boundary shape. Figure 1 in: Gorbet, G. E., Mohapatra, S., & Demeler, B. (2018).

UltraScan is a comprehensive data analysis software package for hydrodynamic data from analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. The software features an integrated data editing and analysis environment with a portable graphical user interface. UltraScan provides the highest possible resolution for sedimentation velocity experiments using high-performance computing modules for 2-dimensional spectrum analysis, genetic algorithm, and for Monte Carlo analysis. A MySQL database backend is integrated for data management, and the UltraScan LIMS system provides web-based access to the database and supercomputing functionality. Supercomputing resources are provided through a NSF Teragrid Science Gateway. Special care has been taken in the design of the software to guarantee an optimum in flexibility, user-friendliness, stability and convenience. The software is written in C++. The software features popular sedimentation velocity and equilibrium analysis methods as well as simulation modules, utilities, and editing modules with support for velocity and equilibrium experiments, single and multi-channel centerpieces, absorbance and interference optics. All analysis methods generate ASCII formatted data suitable for import into third-party plotting programs, and contains a built-in postscript printer engine to generate publication - quality graphical representations of analysis data. UltraScan is offered in two versions, UltraScan-II and UltraScan-III. The latter is a complete rewrite of the former, with many new features and a greatly improved interface. UltraScan-III was released in the summer of 2011 and will eventually replace the older version. We will maintain UltraScan-II to assure access to legacy data because UltraScan-III is not backward compatible with UltraScan-II. New users are encouraged to switch to UltraScan-III. In addition to numerous interface changes, the most important changes in UltraScan-III are listed below: UltraScan-III adheres to the OpenAUC standard. Can be used simultaneously in a local disk-only mode without the requirement for network connectivity, or fully integrated with network capability, including a database and supercomputing backend Contains a local 2DSA that is multi-threaded to take advantage of multi-core technology All hydrodynamic models are represented in a single, generalized and standard structure that can be interpreted by the ASTFEM simulator and understood throughout the program. All experimental data are stored in a new binary format that achieves 60-80% compression from the legacy Beckman data format All network communications are SSL encrypted and provide data privacy and security. Data ownership in the database is on a per-user level now A master password mechanism facilitates switching between multiple resources. A new rotor stretch calibration routine assures maximum accuracy for individually calibrated rotors A new reporting system provides much improved control over result report formatting Plots can be exported not only as bitmap, postscript, or PDF but also as SVG files which can be edited later on Finite element analysis for all methods, as well as data management is greatly improved to reduce the workflow without compromising flexibility The LIMS component of UltraScan, coupled with the high-performance computing backend dramatically improves analysis speed and throughput and allows simultaneous analysis of a virtually unlimited number of experiments.

These pages are created to help users navigate UltraScan and get the best out of this software. Each section is listed below with a quick description of what each subsection module does. The individual pages on each module are linked and provide a detailed explaination through how to use them. The most commonly used modules will be in red text. Edit Edit Data All experimental data aquired with the AUC requires pre-processing. This module creates an edit profile of the data. A user can create multiple edit profiles, and each profile receives a unique name. UltraScan assists in the process by handling the most essential diagnosics and editing steps automatically, but the user can intervene when necessary. Preferences This module contains a number of parameters that can be set to customize UltraScan according to personal preferences. This include directory paths, font and colour preferences, database preferences, and master password. Velocity Enhanced van Holde-Weischet This module differentiates boundary spreading due to diffusion from the boundary spreading due to the heterogeneity in sedimentation coefficients. Use this analysis technqiue using the fit generated by the final 2DSA refinement model. Then use Combine Distributions Plots (vHW) to view the boundary fraction as a function of sedimentation coefficient. Custom 2-D Grid Control This module enables you to edit custom 2-D initialization grids for the 2DSA. 2-D Spectrum Analysis This module enables you to perfrom a 2DSA on a chosen experimental data set. Upon completion of an analysis fit, the following avaliable plots include: experiment; simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals; time-invarient noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-D model. Paramertically Constrained Spectrum Analysis This module enables you to perfrom a PSCA on a chosen experimental data set. Upon completion of an analysis fit, the following avaliable plots include: experiment; simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals; time-invarient noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-D model. Initialize Genetic Algorithm This genetic algorithm program will generate solute distribution data. The output data is required in order to perform a genetic algorithm analysis on the UltraScan LIMS database. Initialize Discrete Model Genetic Algorithm Second Moment This module is used to calculate the weight-average sedimentation coefficeints for each scan included in an analysis by finding the second moment point of the boundary. Time Derivative This module allows you to determine the initial range of the sedimentation coefficient. FE Model Viewer This module is used to import, display, and export finite element solutions fitted to velocity experiments by various methods. It will import models from finite element fitting sessions, 2DSA fitts, genetic algorithm fits, or C(s) fits. It will then compare the fitted model to the experimental data, and display residual plots, sedimentation and diffusion coefficient distributions, as well as molecular weight distributions. These models can be displayed as a 3-D plot showing partial concentrations on a 2-D grid of any of the two folllowing parameters: \\(s\\) , \\(D\\) , \\(f/f_{0}\\) , and MW. The residual plot includes deconvoluted time- and radially- invariant noise plots. All results can be saved. FE Model Statistics This module allows you to obtain statistics for a model computed by any finite element analysis modeule in UltraScan. The following metrics are supported: three distribuion limits, $D_{i}%; span computed from the distribution limits; concentration integral between the lowest and highest distribution limit; maximum and minimum X-value of the distribution; mean, mode, and median of the distribution, and; skew and kurtosis of the distribution. View Pseudo 3-D Distributions Using this module, you may display solution distribution data in a pseudo-3-D form where the Z-axis is simulated using colors in a color map. Data from different cells can be combined. Speed Ramp Analysis Utilities Data Aquisition Import Experimental Data Here you can import and convert experimental raw data into a set of files written in the UltraScan III OpenAUC format. This file is a binary file containing all the information from a single dataset or tripe (cell/channel/wavelength). Export openAUC Data FDS File Manager This module allos you to manage the scan files created by the AOS Fluorescence Detector data aquisitin software. Fit Meniscus This module allows you to modify an edited data set's meniscus value based on meniscus-fit models. A polynomial fit to a set of meniscus-RMSD points is plotted and its low point presented as the default new meniscus value. That value - or a manually modified one - can then replace the value in the associated Edited data set. The model with closest meniscus value in the set of fit-meniscus models that were obtained by a front-end or back-end meniscus fit 2DSA run can be preserved, while all other models in the set (and any associated noises) are removed. Spectral Analysis Color Gradient Generator Report Generator Rotor Calibration License Manager Combine Distribution Plots (vHW) This module combines integral van Holde-Weischet G(s) distributions from multiple datasets, allowing you to compare integral distributions from different cells to each other. It is useful when you want to analyze the same sample under different conditions (for example, different pH levels, or different concentrations). All distributions are plotted relative to the boundary fraction used in analysis. Combine Discrete Distributions This module combines model distributions from multiple datasets, allowing you to compare bar plots of distributions from different cells to each other. Distribution plots present relative concentration (Y) for X, which may be the sedimentation coefficient, molecular weight, diffusion coefficient, frictional ratio, or partial specific density. Combine Integral Distributions Create Global Model This module combines models into a single global model that can be used in global fits. Most commonly, this module is used to form an input to the Initialize Genetic Algorithm program in which a global set of buckets may be created for use in a global fit Genetic Algorithm run. View Raw CFA Data View Raw Optima Data View Time State Density Matching Pseudo-Absorbance MultiWavelength View Multiwavelength Data View MWL Spectral MWL Species Fit Optima MWL Fit Simulation Simulation Finite Element Simulation This module is used to simulate an exxperiment using ASTFEM or ASTFVM methods.

This file is a binary file containing all the information from a single dataset or tripe (cell/channel/wavelength). Export openAUC Data FDS File Manager This module allos you to manage the scan files created by the AOS Fluorescence Detector data aquisitin software. Fit Meniscus This module allows you to modify an edited data set's meniscus value based on meniscus-fit models. A polynomial fit to a set of meniscus-RMSD points is plotted and its low point presented as the default new meniscus value. That value - or a manually modified one - can then replace the value in the associated Edited data set. The model with closest meniscus value in the set of fit-meniscus models that were obtained by a front-end or back-end meniscus fit 2DSA run can be preserved, while all other models in the set (and any associated noises) are removed. Spectral Analysis Color Gradient Generator Report Generator Rotor Calibration License Manager Combine Distribution Plots (vHW) This module combines integral van Holde-Weischet G(s) distributions from multiple datasets, allowing you to compare integral distributions from different cells to each other. It is useful when you want to analyze the same sample under different conditions (for example, different pH levels, or different concentrations). All distributions are plotted relative to the boundary fraction used in analysis. Combine Discrete Distributions This module combines model distributions from multiple datasets, allowing you to compare bar plots of distributions from different cells to each other. Distribution plots present relative concentration (Y) for X, which may be the sedimentation coefficient, molecular weight, diffusion coefficient, frictional ratio, or partial specific density. Combine Integral Distributions Create Global Model This module combines models into a single global model that can be used in global fits. Most commonly, this module is used to form an input to the Initialize Genetic Algorithm program in which a global set of buckets may be created for use in a global fit Genetic Algorithm run.

The PCSA pass proceeds for a set of models each of which consists of the solute points along a curve in s,f/f0 space. The model whose RMSD of the resulting residuals (simulation-experimental difference) is the lowest forms the starting point for a second phase which uses Levenberg-Marquardt to refine the model to a final output model.

Each analysis run proceeds over a defined set of curves in s and f/f0 space. The single analysis pass produces the model whose associated simulation differs the least from the experimental data, as determined by its RMSD value. Time-invariant and/or radially-invariant noise(s) may also be computed. The curves in a set cover a specified s and f/f0 range and vary according to a specified increment or count. Each model has a specified number of input solute points along its curve. After an initial pass in which all the specified model curves are evaluated, the results are sorted by fitness (least RMSD). The best model then becomes the starting point for a second pass that utilizes Levenberg-Marquardt to refine the model. The result of that second pass is inserted as the final best model. FITTING CONTROLS \\(\\textbf{Variations Count}\\) Specify the number of curve variations in each direction to form the model. Usually, the square of this number is the number of models to analyze. \\(\\textbf{Grid Fit Iterations}\\) Specify the number of iterations of fixed grid fits to perform. Each iteration after the first starts with a range of par1 and par2 values of f/f0 values that is refined from the best models of the previous iteration. \\(\\textbf{Threshold Delta-RMSD Ratio}\\) Specify the ratio of the delta in RMSD to previous iteration RMSD that is the threshold below which the iterative scan is taken to have converged. \\(\\textbf{Curve Resolution Points}\\) Specify the number of points to generate for each test time. This is the number of solute points that each model will have. \\(\\textbf{Maximum L-M Evalute Calls}\\) Specify the maximum number of Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) evaluate cells to allow. The default of 100 is almost always sufficient. This value is used to insure that a run-away condition will not occur. Additionally, a value of 0 may be specified to supress L-M and use the final fixed grid best model as the overall best model. \\(\\textbf{Regularize in L-M Fits}\\) This box should normally remain unchecked, but you may check it to test regularizatio during the L-M stage of model fitting. \\(\\textbf{Regularize in Grid Fits}\\) \\(\\textbf{Thread Count}\\) Define the number of threads that is appropriate to the complexity of the run and the number of processors or cores avaliable. \\(\\textbf{Fit Time-Invariant Noise}\\) Check this box if you want to calculate time-invariant noise. \\(\\textbf{Fit Radially-Invariant Noise}\\) Check this box if you want to calculate radially-invariant noise. \\(\\textbf{Perform Regularization Scan}\\) Once fit analysis is complete, you may optionally click here to bring up a dialog that will set the best value for the Regularization Parameter. \\(\\textbf{Recompute Best Model}\\) \\(\\textbf{Advanced Controls}\\) \\(\\textbf{Plot Model Lines}\\) Click this button to open a dialog showing the Model Lines. \\(\\textbf{Best Model Variance}\\) The mimimum value for models thus computed.

Upon completion of an analysis fit, plots available include: model lines; experiment; simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals; time-invariant noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-d model. Final outputs may include a model and computed noises. The PCSA method is used for composition analysis of sedimentation velocity experiments. It can generate sedimentation coefficient, diffusion coefficient, frictional coefficient, f/f0 ratio, and molecular weight distributions. The distributions can be plotted as 3-dimensional plots (2 parameters from the above list against each other), with the third dimension representing the concentration of the solute found in the composition analysis. The set of all such final calculated solutes form a model which is used to generate a simulation via Lamm equations. The simulation is plotted overlaying a plot of experimental data. The PCSA pass proceeds for a set of models each of which consists of the solute points along a curve in s,f/f0 space. The model whose RMSD of the resulting residuals (simulation-experimental difference) is the lowest forms the starting point for a second phase which uses Levenberg-Marquardt to refine the model to a final output model.
